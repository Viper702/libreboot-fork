		<h1>
			Rationale
		</h1>
			<p>
				Most people think of security on the software side: the hardware is important aswell.
			</p>
			<p>
				This tutorial deals with reducing the number of devices that have direct memory access that
				could communicate with inputs/outputs that could be used to remotely
				command the system (or leak data). All of this is purely theoretical for the time being.
			</p>

		<h1 id="procedure">Disassembly</h1>

			<p>
				Firstly remove the bluetooth (if your X60 has this):<br/>
				The marked screws are underneath those stickers (marked in those 3 locations at the bottom of the LCD assembly):<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0000_bluetooth0.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
				Now gently pry off the bottom part of the front bezel, and the bluetooth module is on the left (easily removable):<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0000_bluetooth.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				If your model was WWAN, remove the simcard (check anyway):<br/>
				Uncover those 2 screws at the bottom:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0000_simcard0.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
				SIM card (not present in the picture) is in the marked location:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0000_simcard1.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
				Replacement: USB dongle.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now get into the motherboard.
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove those screws:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0000.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Push the keyboard forward (carefully):<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0001.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Lift the keyboard up and disconnect it from the board:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0002.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Grab the right-hand side of the chassis and force it off (gently) and pry up the rest of the chassis:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0003.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				You should now have this:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0004.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				The following is a summary of what you will remove (already done to this system):<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0001_overview.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
				Note: the blue lines represent antenna cables and modem cables. You don't need to remove these, but you can if you want
				(to make it tidier after removing other parts). I removed the antenna wires, the modem jack, the modem cable and
				also (on another model) a device inside the part where the wwan antenna goes (wasn't sure what it was, but I knew it wasn't needed). <b>This is optional</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the microphone (can desolder it, but you can also easily pull it off with you hands). Already removed here:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0001_microphone.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
				<b>Rationale:</b><br/>
				Another reason to remove the microphone: If your computer gets<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> compromised, it can
				record what you say, and use it to receive data from nearby devices if
				they're compromised too. Also, we do not know what the built-in microcode (in the CPU) is doing; it could theoretically
				be programmed to accept remote commands from some speaker somewhere (remote security hole). <b>In other words,
				the system could already be compromised from the factory.</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the modem:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0001_modem.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
				(useless, obsolete device)
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the speaker:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0001_speaker.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
				Reason: combined with the microphone issue, this could be used to leak data.<br/>
				If your computer gets<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> compromised, it can be used to
				transmit data to nearby compromised devices. It's unknown if it can be
				turned into a microphone<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.<br/>
				Replacement: headphones/speakers (line-out) or external DAC (USB).
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the wlan (also remove wwan if you have it):<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_security/0001_wlan_wwan.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
				Reason: has direct (and very fast) memory access, and could (theoretically) leak data over a side-channel.<br/>
				<b>Wifi:</b> The ath5k/ath9k cards might not have firmware at all. They might safe but could have
				access to the computer's RAM trough DMA. If people have an intel
				card(most X60s come with Intel wifi by default, until you change it),then that card runs
				a non-free firwamre and has access to the computer's RAM trough DMA! So
				the risk-level is very high.<br/>
				<b>Wwan (3g modem):</b> They run proprietary software! It's like AMT but over the GSM network which is
				probably even worse.<br/>
				Replacement: external USB wifi dongle. (or USB wwan/3g dongle; note, this has all the same privacy issues as mobile phones. wwan not recommended).

			Extra notes
		</h1>
			<p>
				EC: Cannot be removed but can be mitigated: it contains non-free
				non-loadable code, but it has no access to the computer's RAM.
				It has access to the on-switch of the wifi, bluetooth, modem and some
				other power management features. The issue is that it has access to the
				keyboard, however if the software security howto <b>(not yet written)</b> is followed correctly,
				it won't be able to leak data to a local attacker. It has no network
				access but it may still be able to leak data remotely, but that
				requires someone to be nearby to recover the data with the help of an
				SDR and some directional antennas<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Intel_82573_Ethernet_controller">Intel 82573 Ethernet controller</a>
				on the X60 seems safe, according to Denis.

				<h2 id="ref1">[1] physical access</h2>
					<p>
						Explain that black hats, TAO, and so on might use a 0day to get in,
						and explain that in this case it mitigates what the attacker can do.
						Also the TAO do some evaluation before launching an attack: they take
						the probability of beeing caught into account, along with the kind of
						target. A 0day costs a lot of money, I heard that it was from 100000$
						to 400000$, some other websites had prices 10 times lower but that
						but it was probably a typo. So if people increase their security it
						makes it more risky and more costly to attack people.

			<div class="subsection">
				<h2 id="ref2">[2] microphone</h2>
					<p>
						It's possible to turn headphones into a microphone, you could try
						yourself, however they don't record loud at all. Also intel cards have
						the capability to change a connector's function, for instance the
						microphone jack can now become a headphone plug, that's called
						retasking. There is some support for it in GNU/Linux but it's not very
						well known.

						30c3-5356-en-Firmware_Fat_Camp_webm.webm from the 30th CCC. While
