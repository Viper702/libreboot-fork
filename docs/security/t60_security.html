		<h1>
			Rationale
		</h1>
			<p>
				Most people think of security on the software side: the hardware is important aswell.
			</p>
			<p>
				This tutorial deals with reducing the number of devices that have direct memory access that
				could communicate with inputs/outputs that could be used to remotely
				command the system (or leak data). All of this is purely theoretical for the time being.
			</p>
	</div>

		<h1 id="procedure">Disassembly</h1>

			<p>
				Remove those screws and remove the HDD:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0001.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0002.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Lift off the palm rest:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0003.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Lift up the keyboard, pull it back a bit, flip it over like that and then disconnect it from the board:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0004.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0005.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0006.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Gently wedge both sides loose:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0007.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0008.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove that cable from the position:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0009.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0010.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Now remove that bezel. Remove wifi, nvram battery and speaker connector (also remove 56k modem, on the left of wifi):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0011.JPG" alt="" /><br/>
				Reason: has direct (and very fast) memory access, and could (theoretically) leak data over a side-channel.<br/>
				<b>Wifi:</b> The ath5k/ath9k cards might not have firmware at all. They might safe but could have
				access to the computer's RAM trough DMA. If people have an intel
				card(most T60 laptops come with Intel wifi by default, until you change it),then that card runs
				a non-free firwamre and has access to the computer's RAM trough DMA! So
				the risk-level is very high.
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove those screws:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0012.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect the power jack:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0013.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove nvram battery (we will put it back later):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0014.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect cable (for 56k modem) and disconnect the other cable:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0015.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0016.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect speaker cable:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0017.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect the other end of the 56k modem cable:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0018.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Make sure you removed it:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0019.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Unscrew those:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0020.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Make sure you removed those:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0021.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect LCD cable from board:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0022.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p> 
				Remove those screws then remove the LCD assembly:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0023.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0024.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0025.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Once again, make sure you removed those:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0026.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the shielding containing the motherboard, then flip it over. Remove these screws, placing them on a steady
				surface in the same layout as they were in before you removed them. Also, you should mark each screw hole after removing the
				screw (a permanent marker pen will do), this is so that you have a point of reference when re-assembling the system:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0027.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0028.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0029.JPG" alt="" />
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0031.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0032.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0033.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove microphone (soldering iron not needed. Just wedge it out gently):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0039.JPG" alt="" /><br/>
				<b>Rationale:</b><br/>
				Another reason to remove the microphone: If your computer gets<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> compromised, it can
				record what you say, and use it to receive data from nearby devices if
				they're compromised too. Also, we do not know what the built-in microcode (in the CPU) is doing; it could theoretically
				be programmed to accept remote commands from some speaker somewhere (remote security hole). <b>In other words,
				the system could already be compromised from the factory.</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove infrared:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0040.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0042.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove cardbus (it's in a socket, no need to disable. Just remove the port itself):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0041.JPG" alt="" /><br/>
				<b>Rationale:</b><br/>
				It has direct memory access and can be used to extract sensitive details (such as LUKS keys). See
				'GoodBIOS' video linked at the end (speaker is Peter Stuge, a coreboot hacker). The video covers X60
				but the same topics apply to T60.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before re-installing the upper chassis, remove the speaker:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0043.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0044.JPG" alt="" /><br/>
				Reason: combined with the microphone issue, this could be used to leak data.<br/>
				If your computer gets<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> compromised, it can be used to
				transmit data to nearby compromised devices. It's unknown if it can be
				turned into a microphone<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.<br/>
				Replacement: headphones/speakers (line-out) or external DAC (USB).
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the wwan:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0045.JPG" alt="" /><br/>
				<b>Wwan (3g modem):</b> They run proprietary software! It's like AMT but over the GSM network which is
				probably even worse.<br/>
				Replacement: external USB wifi dongle. (or USB wwan/3g dongle; note, this has all the same privacy issues as mobile phones. wwan not recommended).
			</p>

			<p>
				This is where the simcard connector is soldered. See notes above about wwan. Remove simcard by removing battery
				and then it's accessible (so, remember to do this when you re-assemble. or you could do it now?)<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0046.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Put those screws back:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0047.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Put it back into lower chassis:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0048.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Attach LCD and insert screws (also, attach the lcd cable to the board):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0049.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Insert those screws:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0050.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				On the CPU (and there is another chip south-east to it, sorry forgot to take pic)
				clean off the old thermal paste (with the alcohol) and apply new (Artic Silver 5 is good, others are good too)
				you should also clean the heatsink the same way<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0051.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Attach the heatsink and install the screws (also, make sure to install the AC jack as highlighted):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0052.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Reinstall that upper bezel:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0053.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Do that:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0054.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0055.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Attach keyboard and install nvram battery:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0056.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0057.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Place keyboard and (sorry, forgot to take pics) reinstall the palmrest and insert screws on the underside:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0058.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove those covers and unscrew:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0059.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0060.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0061.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Gently pry off the front bezel (sorry, forgot to take pics).
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove bluetooth module:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0062.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0063.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Re-attach the front bezel and re-insert the screws (sorry, forgot to take pics).
			</p>

			<p>
				It lives!<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0071.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0072.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0073.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Always stress test ('stress -c 2' and xsensors. below 90C is ok) when replacing cpu paste/heatsink:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0074.JPG" alt="" />

				EC: Cannot be removed but can be mitigated: it contains non-free
				non-loadable code, but it has no access to the computer's RAM.
				It has access to the on-switch of the wifi, bluetooth, modem and some
				other power management features. The issue is that it has access to the
				keyboard, however if the software security howto <b>(not yet written)</b> is followed correctly,
				it won't be able to leak data to a local attacker. It has no network
				access but it may still be able to leak data remotely, but that
				requires someone to be nearby to recover the data with the help of an
				SDR and some directional antennas<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.

				<h2 id="ref1">[1] physical access</h2>
					<p>
						Explain that black hats, TAO, and so on might use a 0day to get in,
						and explain that in this case it mitigates what the attacker can do.
						Also the TAO do some evaluation before launching an attack: they take
						the probability of beeing caught into account, along with the kind of
						target. A 0day costs a lot of money, I heard that it was from 100000$
						to 400000$, some other websites had prices 10 times lower but that
						but it was probably a typo. So if people increase their security it
						makes it more risky and more costly to attack people.

				<h2 id="ref2">[2] microphone</h2>
					<p>
						It's possible to turn headphones into a microphone, you could try
						yourself, however they don't record loud at all. Also intel cards have
						the capability to change a connector's function, for instance the
						microphone jack can now become a headphone plug, that's called
						retasking. There is some support for it in GNU/Linux but it's not very
						well known.
