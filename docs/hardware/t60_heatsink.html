				Using this guide you can also change/upgrade the CPU.

			<ul>
				<li>rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, and thermal compound for changing CPU heatsink (procedure involves removing heatsink)</li>
				<li>thermal compound/paste (Arctic MX-4 is good. Others are also good.)</li>

				Remove those screws and remove the HDD:<br/>

			</p>

			<p>
				Lift off the palm rest:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0003.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Lift up the keyboard, pull it back a bit, flip it over like that and then disconnect it from the board:<br/>

			</p>

			<p>
				Gently wedge both sides loose:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0007.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0008.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove that cable from the position:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0009.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0010.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the bezel (sorry forgot to take pics).
			</p>

			<p>
				On the CPU (and there is another chip south-east to it, sorry forgot to take pic)
				clean off the old thermal paste (with the alcohol) and apply new (Artic Silver 5 is good, others are good too)
				you should also clean the heatsink the same way<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0051.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				This is also an opportunity to change the CPU to another one. For example if you had a Core Duo T2400, you can upgrade it to a better processor
				(higher speed, 64-bit support). A Core 2 Duo T7600 was installed here.
			</p>

			<p>
				Attach the heatsink and install the screws (also, make sure to install the AC jack as highlighted):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0052.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Reinstall that upper bezel:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0053.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Do that:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0054.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0055.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Attach keyboard:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0056.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Place keyboard and (sorry, forgot to take pics) reinstall the palmrest and insert screws on the underside:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0058.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				It lives!<br/>

			</p>

			<p>
				Always stress test ('stress -c 2' and xsensors. below 90C is ok) when replacing cpu paste/heatsink:<br/>
