			<p>
				Remove those screws:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0000.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Push the keyboard forward (carefully):<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0001.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Lift the keyboard up and disconnect it from the board:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0002.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Grab the right-hand side of the chassis and force it off (gently) and pry up the rest of the chassis:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0003.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				You should now have this:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0004.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Disconnect the wifi antenna cables, the modem cable and the speaker:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0005.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Unroute the cables along their path, carefully lifting the tape that holds them in place. Then, disconnect the modem
				cable (other end) and power connection and unroute all the cables so that they dangle by the monitor hinge on the right-hand
				side:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0006.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Disconnect the monitor from the motherboard, and unroute the grey antenna cable, carefully lifting the tape
				that holds it into place:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0008.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Carefully lift the remaining tape and unroute the left antenna cable so that it is loose:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0009.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Remove those screws:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0011.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Remove those screws:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0012.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Carefully remove the plate, like so:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0013.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Remove the SATA connector:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0014.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Now remove the motherboard (gently) and cast the lcd/chassis aside:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0015.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Look at that black tape above the heatsink, remove it:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0016.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Now you have removed it:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0017.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect the fan and remove all the screws, heatsink will easily come off:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60_heatsink/0018.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the old paste with a cloth (from the CPU and heatsink) and then clean both of them with the alcohol (to remove remaining residue of the paste).
				Apply a pea-sized amount of paste to the both chipsets that the heatsink covered and spread it evenly (uniformally).
				Finally reinstall the heatsink, reversing previous steps.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>stress -c 2</b> command can be used to push the CPU to 100%, and <b>xsensors</b> (or <b>watch sensors</b> command) can be used to monitor heat. 
				Below 90C is ok.
