		<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

			<p>
				The way the libreboot project is run is very similar to how
				a GNU/Linux distribution project is run (but for the boot
				firmware, not your operating system). Thus, libreboot is
				a <i>coreboot distribution</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This page demonstrates on a high level how
				libreboot is maintained, how the project is run, how everything
				goes together, etc. For a more detailed guide, refer to each
				subsection for the various components/modules used in libreboot.

		<h1 id="updating_coreboot">Updating coreboot-libre</h1>

			<p>
				NOTE: it helps to own all libreboot-compatible systems here,
				or have reliable (and fast) access to a team of testers.
			</p>

			<p>
				Coreboot-libre is the name of the deblobbed coreboot sources
				used in libreboot. It is also the name of the collection
				of scripts used for deblobbing coreboot, on each new update.
			</p>

			<p>
				This section shows an example of how to update (re-base) to
				the latest version of coreboot, how to update the deblobbing
				scripts, and so on. <b>This does not teach you how to
				change what custom patches are used, nor does it tell
				you how to add new boards to libreboot. It assumes that you
				simply want to re-base to the latest version (for instance,
				there could be bug fixes that you want). For those things
				not listed in this section, you can refer to other sections
				on this page instead.</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Open these files in your editor (you will most likely be editing them):
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>resources/scripts/helpers/download/coreboot</li>
					<li>resources/scripts/helpers/build/module/coreboot</li>
					<li>resources/utilities/coreboot-libre/deblob</li>

					<li>resources/scripts/helpers/build/roms/helper</li>
					<li>resources/scripts/helpers/build/roms/withgrub</li>
				</ul>

			<p>
				If you already had a coreboot/ directory in your libreboot
				tree, delete it:<br/>
				$ <b>rm -Rf coreboot/</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Firstly, download coreboot. Do <b>not</b> use <b>./download coreboot</b>
				for this, just clone coreboot, as it does in that script, like so:<br/>
				$ <b>git clone http://review.coreboot.org/coreboot</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				$ <b>cd coreboot/</b><br/>
				Get the ID of the latest commit in this clone, by reading the commit ID using
				e.g.:<br/>
				$ <b>git log</b><br/>
				In <i>resources/scripts/helpers/download/coreboot</i> you will
				find a line that says <i><b>git reset --hard</b></i> and then
				a commit ID next to it. Replace this with the commit ID of the latest
				commit from the coreboot version that you just downloaded.
			</p>
			<p>
				You must also checkout the <i>vboot</i> submodule:<br/>
				$ <b>git submodule update --init --checkout -- 3rdparty/vboot/</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Delete the .git* resources. For example:<br/>
				$ <b>rm -Rf .git* 3rdparty/*/.git*</b><br/>
				...this is to avoid the deblobbing script from picking up files
				in there as blobs, which would be only false positives and
				increase the amount of time taken. Now come out of coreboot:<br/>
				$ <b>cd ../</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Check all coreboot file names/paths in <i>deblob</i>; if any
				of them no longer exist at that name/path in the coreboot tree that you downloaded, 
				delete the reference(s) in <i>deblob</i>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Check all coreboot file names/paths in <i>nonblobs</i>; if
				any of them no longer exist at that name/path in the coreboot tree that you downloaded,
				delete the reference in <i>nonblobs</i>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, back in the main root directory of libreboot (git repository),
				run the deblob script. This is to prevent the <i>findblobs</i>
				scripts from finding the blobs that are already deleted
				when running the <i>deblob</i> script. Like so:<br/>
				$ <b>./resources/utilities/coreboot-libre/deblob</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Now search for new blobs:<br/>
				$ <b>cd resources/utilities/coreboot-libre/</b><br/>
				$ <b>./findblobs</b><br/>
				WARNING: this will take a <b>*long*</b> time. Be patient!
				What this will do is look through the coreboot source directory,
				looking for blobs. It will not find the blobs that you deleted
				before (because they no longer exist), and it will ignore any
				files listed in <i>nonblobs</i>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once the <i>findblobs</i> script has finished, check the file
				<i>tocheck</i> (from the root, this will be <i>resources/utilities/coreboot-libre/tocheck</i>).
				These are the files detected as blobs; some might be blobs, some not.
				The <i>findblobs</i> script doesn't know how to determine between blobs
				and non-blobs, it only knows patterns. Distinguishing between blobs and
				non-blobs must be performed by you, the human being.
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Files in <i>tocheck</i> that you identify as blobs,
						should be added appropriately to <i>resources/utilities/coreboot-libre/deblob</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						Files in <i>tocheck</i> that you identify as non-blobs,
						should be added appropriately to <i>resources/utilities/coreboot-libre/nonblobs</i> -
						also, if you feel it necessary, add an explanation of it in
						<i>resources/utilities/coreboot-libre/nonblobs_notes</i>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<p>
				Now come back to the main libreboot root directory (root
				of the git clone). If you are still in resources/utilities/coreboot-libre/
				for instance, you would do something like:<br/>
				$ <b>cd ../../../</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Now delete the coreboot directory:<br/>
				$ <b>rm -Rf coreboot/</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Download coreboot again, only this time, using the download
				script. The download script also applies custom patches
				to coreboot (see resources/scripts/helpers/download/coreboot);
				if they do not apply anymore, you will have to re-base them
				and then update <i>resources/scripts/helpers/download/coreboot</i>
				accordingly. Anyway, download coreboot like so:<br/>
				$ <b>./download coreboot</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				If the custom patches no longer apply, and you have to re-base
				(or replace?) some patches, please do this in coreboot upstream,
				not in libreboot. Then re-include new patches from upstream,
				into libreboot. Here is coreboot's guide for contributing
				patches:<br/>
				<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Git">http://www.coreboot.org/Git</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Update all configs:<br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubupdate</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build config dcupdate</b><br/>
				This simply takes all of the coreboot <b>.config</b> files from
				<i>resources/libreboot/config/</i> and does <b>make oldconfig</b>
				on them. It usually works. If it doesn't, you'll need to recreate
				those configs from scratch using <b>./build config grubreplace</b>
				or <b>./build config dcreplace</b> (optionally
				add a config name), or <b>./build config grubmodify</b>
				or <b>./build config dcmodify</b> (ditto)
				(see <a href="../git/index.html#config">../git/index.html#config</a>)
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, build *all* ROM images using the instructions at
				<a href="../git/index.html">../git/index.html</a>, to verify
				that everything still builds.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once you've verified that building isn't broken, test *all*
				boards (you don't need to test all ROM images, only one
				vesafb and one txtmode image for each configuration). If you
				do not have all systems supported in libreboot, then you will
				need to get other testers for those boards.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you have established a build issue, or a board no longer
				works (booting issues, bugs during/after boot, etc), you'll
				need to fix it upstream:
				<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Git">http://www.coreboot.org/Git</a>
				and then re-update coreboot (or apply patches from upstream).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You should also test the resulting ROM images from building
				with the new or modified coreboot revision.

		<h1 id="newboard_libreboot">Adding a new board to libreboot</h1>

			<p>
				Make sure that the board is supported, and that the patches
				are included (if there are custom patches that you need).
				Add configs for it like so (for GRUB payload):<br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubreplace <i>payload</i>/<i>boardname</i></b><br/>
				Alternatively, for depthcharge payload:<br/>
				$ <b>./build config dcreplace <i>payload</i>/<i>boardname</i></b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This can also be used for replacing an existing config.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Configure the board. Make sure to add the steps to the config section
				in <a href="../git/index.html">../git/index.html</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When you're done, the config will be stored in <i>resources/libreboot/config/</i>.
				Now build-test it and then check that it actually works.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The following scripts may also need to be modified before building:
				<i>resources/scripts/helpers/build/roms/withgrub</i> and
				<i>resources/scripts/helpers/build/roms/helper</i>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The following can be used when updating coreboot-libre (GRUB payload):<br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubupdate</b><br/>
				You must also do this for boards that use the depthcharge payload:<br/>
				$ <b>./build config dcupdate</b><br/>
				(adding a board name on the end is optional, for either of these)
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The following can be used if you want to modify an existing
				configuration (GRUB payload):<br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubmodify</b><br/>
				For those boards which use the depthcharge payload:<br/>
				$ <b>./build config dcmodify</b><br/>
				(adding a board name on the end is optional)
			</p>

			<p>
				Examples (GRUB payload):<br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubmodify x60</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubreplace x60</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubupdate x60</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubmodify kfsn4-dre</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubreplace kfsn4-dre</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build config grubupdate kfsn4-dre</b><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Examples (depthcharge payload):<br/>
				$ <b>./build config dcmodify veyron_speedy</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build config dcreplace veyron_speedy</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build config dcupdate veyron_speedy</b>

		<h1 id="newpatch_libreboot">Add/remove/modify patches in coreboot-libre</h1>

			<p>
				Under <b>resources/scripts/helpers/download/coreboot</b> you can find
				the instructions used for patching coreboot.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Modify the commit ID on the <i>git reset --hard</i> line accordingly, 
				and update the list of patches used accordingly. Do not cherry-pick
				from review.coreboot.org directly; instead, include the diff in
				resources/libreboot/patch/ and use <i>git am</i>
				(you can get the diff by using git-format-patch).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When you're done, simply download coreboot again:<br/>
				$ <b>./download coreboot</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Finally, re-build the parts from coreboot that are used
				by the build system (also builds GCC):<br/>
				$ <b>./build module coreboot</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before running the above command, you can save time
				by copying out the crossgcc that you compiled before
				(from coreboot/util/crossgcc/) and then putting it back.
				After you've done that, run everything in
				<i>resources/scripts/helpers/build/module/coreboot</i>
				except for the part that builds GCC.
				<b>Only do this if the version is correct.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You should also test the resulting ROM images from building
				with the new or modified coreboot revision.
