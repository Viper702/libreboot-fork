		<h1>Installing Trisquel GNU/Linux with full disk encryption (including /boot)</h1>
			<p>
				Libreboot on x86 uses the GRUB <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Payloads#GRUB_2">payload</a> 
				by default, which means that the GRUB configuration file 
				(where your GRUB menu comes from) is stored directly alongside libreboot
				and its GRUB payload executable, inside
				the flash chip. In context, this means that installing distributions and managing them 
				is handled slightly differently compared to traditional BIOS systems.
			</p>

			<p>
				On most systems, the /boot partition has to be left unencrypted while the others are encrypted.
				This is so that GRUB, and therefore the kernel, can be loaded and executed since the firmware
				can't open a LUKS volume. Not so with libreboot! Since GRUB is already included directly as a 
				payload, even /boot can be encrypted. This protects /boot from tampering by someone with physical
				access to the system.
			</p>
			<p>
				This works in Trisquel 7, and probably Trisquel 6. Boot the 'net installer' (Install Trisquel in Text Mode). 
				<a href="grub_boot_installer.html">How to boot a GNU/Linux installer</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>This guide is *only* for the GRUB payload. If you use the depthcharge payload, ignore this section entirely.</b>
			</p>


            <p>
            Note: on some thinkpads, a faulty DVD drive can cause the cryptomount -a step during boot to fail. If this happens to you, try removing the drive.

			Set a strong user password (lots of lowercase/uppercase, numbers and symbols).
		</p>

		<p>
			Use of the <i>diceware method</i> is recommended, for generating secure passphrases (instead of passwords).
		</p>

		<p>
			when the installer asks you to set up
			encryption (ecryptfs) for your home directory, select 'Yes' if you want to: <b>LUKS is already secure and performs well. Having ecryptfs on top of it
			will add noticeable performance penalty, for little security gain in most use cases. This is therefore optional, and not recommended.
			Choose 'no'.</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>
				Your user password should be different from the LUKS password which you will set later on.
				Your LUKS password should, like the user password, be secure.

		<h1>Partitioning</h1>

			<p>Choose 'Manual' partitioning:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Select drive and create new partition table</li>
					<li>
						Single large partition. The following are mostly defaults:
						<ul>
							<li>Use as: physical volume for encryption</li>
							<li>Encryption: aes</li>
							<li>key size: 256</li>
							<li>IV algorithm: xts-plain64</li>
							<li>Encryption key: passphrase</li> (<i>diceware method</i> recommended for choosing password)
							<li>erase data: Yes (only choose 'No' if it's a new drive that doesn't contain your private data)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Select 'configure encrypted volumes'
						<ul>
							<li>Create encrypted volumes</li>
							<li>Select your partition</li>
							<li>Finish</li>
							<li>Really erase: Yes</li>
							<li>(erase will take a long time. be patient)</li>
							<li>(if your old system was encrypted, just let this run for about a minute to
							make sure that the LUKS header is wiped out)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Select encrypted space:
						<ul>
							<li>use as: physical volume for LVM</li>
							<li>Choose 'done setting up the partition'</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Configure the logical volume manager:
						<ul>
							<li>Keep settings: Yes</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Create volume group:
						<ul>
							<li>Name: <b>matrix</b> (you can use whatever you want here, this is just an example)</li>
							<li>Select crypto partition</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Create logical volume
						<ul>
							<li>select <b>matrix</b> (or whatever you named it before)</li>
							<li>name: <b>root</b> (you can use whatever you want here, this is just an example)</li>
							<li>size: default, minus 2048 MB</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Create logical volume
						<ul>
							<li>select <b>matrix</b> (or whatever you named it before)</li>
							<li>name: <b>swap</b> (you can use whatever you want here, this is just an example)</li>
							<li>size: press enter</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
	
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		
		<h1>Further partitioning</h1>

			<p>
				Now you are back at the main partitioning screen. You will simply set mountpoints and filesystems to use.
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						LVM LV root
						<ul>
							<li>use as: ext4</li>
							<li>mount point: /</li>
							<li>done setting up partition</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						LVM LV swap
						<ul>
							<li>use as: swap area</li>
							<li>done setting up partition</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Now you select 'Finished partitioning and write changes to disk'.</li>
				</ul>
	
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		
		<h1>Kernel</h1>

			<p>
				Installation will ask what kernel you want to use. linux-generic is fine.
			</p>
			
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		
		<h1>Tasksel</h1>

			<p>
				Choose <i>&quot;Trisquel Desktop Environment&quot;</i> if you want GNOME, 
				<i>&quot;Trisquel-mini Desktop Environment&quot;</i> if you
				want LXDE or <i>&quot;Triskel Desktop Environment&quot;</i> if you want KDE. 
				If you want to have no desktop (just a basic shell)
				when you boot or if you want to create your own custom setup, then choose nothing here (don't select anything). 
				You might also want to choose some of the other package groups; it's up to you.
			</p>
			
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		
		<h1>Postfix configuration</h1>

			<p>
				If asked, choose <i>&quot;No Configuration&quot;</i> here (or maybe you want to select something else. It's up to you.)
			</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		
		<h1>Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record</h1>

			<p>
				Choose 'Yes'. It will fail, but don't worry. Then at the main menu, choose 'Continue without a bootloader'.
				You could also choose 'No'. Choice is irrelevant here.
			</p>

			<p>
				<i>You do not need to install GRUB at all, since in libreboot you are using the GRUB payload (for libreboot) to boot your system directly.</i>
			</p>
			
	</div>
	
	<div class="section">

		<h1>Clock UTC</h1>

			<p>
				Just say 'Yes'.
			</p>
			
	</div>
	
	<div class="section">

		<h1>
			Booting your system
		</h1>

			<p>
				At this point, you will have finished the installation. At your GRUB payload, press C to get to the command line.
			</p>

			<p>
				Do that:<br/>
				grub&gt; <b>cryptomount -a</b><br/>
				grub&gt; <b>set root='lvm/matrix-root'</b><br/>
				grub&gt; <b>linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/mapper/matrix-root cryptdevice=/dev/mapper/matrix-root:root</b><br/>
				grub&gt; <b>initrd /initrd.img</b><br/>
				grub&gt; <b>boot</b>
			</p>
			
	</div>
	
	<div class="section">

		<h1>
			ecryptfs
		</h1>

			<p>
				If you didn't encrypt your home directory, then you can safely ignore this section.
			</p>

			<p>
				Immediately after logging in, do that:<br/>
				$ <b>sudo ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				This will be needed in the future if you ever need to recover your home directory from another system, so write it down and keep the note
				somewhere secret. Ideally, you should memorize it and then burn the note (or not even write it down, and memorize it still)>
			</p>
			
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		
		<h1>
			Modify grub.cfg (CBFS)
		</h1>

			<p>
				Now you need to set it up so that the system will automatically boot, without having to type a bunch of commands.
			</p>

			<p>
				Modify your grub.cfg (in the firmware) <a href="grub_cbfs.html">using this tutorial</a>; 
				just change the default menu entry 'Load Operating System' to say this inside:
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>cryptomount -a</b><br/>
				<b>set root='lvm/matrix-root'</b><br/>
				<b>linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/mapper/matrix-root cryptdevice=/dev/mapper/matrix-root:root</b><br/>
				<b>initrd /initrd.img</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Without specifying a device, the <i>-a</i> parameter tries to unlock all detected LUKS volumes. 
				You can also specify -u UUID or -a (device).
			</p>

			<p>
				Additionally, you should set a GRUB password. This is not your LUKS password, but it's a password that you have to enter to see
				GRUB. This protects your system from an attacker simply booting a live USB and re-flashing your firmware. <b>This should be different than your LUKS passphrase and user password.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Use of the <i>diceware method</i> is recommended, for generating secure passphrases (as opposed to passwords).
			</p>

			<p>
				The GRUB utility can be used like so:<br/>
				$ <b>grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Give it a password (remember, it has to be secure) and it'll output something like:<br/>
				<b>grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.711F186347156BC105CD83A2ED7AF1EB971AA2B1EB2640172F34B0DEFFC97E654AF48E5F0C3B7622502B76458DA494270CC0EA6504411D676E6752FD1651E749.8DD11178EB8D1F633308FD8FCC64D0B243F949B9B99CCEADE2ECA11657A757D22025986B0FA116F1D5191E0A22677674C994EDBFADE62240E9D161688266A711</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Use of the <i>diceware method</i> is recommended, for generating secure passphrases (instead of passwords).
			</p>

			<p>
				Put that in the grub.cfg (the one for CBFS inside the ROM) before the 'Load Operating System' menu entry like so (example):<br/>
			</p>
			<pre>
<b>set superusers=&quot;root&quot;</b>
<b>password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.711F186347156BC105CD83A2ED7AF1EB971AA2B1EB2640172F34B0DEFFC97E654AF48E5F0C3B7622502B76458DA494270CC0EA6504411D676E6752FD1651E749.8DD11178EB8D1F633308FD8FCC64D0B243F949B9B99CCEADE2ECA11657A757D22025986B0FA116F1D5191E0A22677674C994EDBFADE62240E9D161688266A711</b>
			</pre>
			<p style="font-size:2em;">
				MAKE SURE TO DO THIS ON grubtest.cfg *BEFORE* DOING IT ON grub.cfg.
				Then select the menu entry that says <i>Switch to grubtest.cfg</i> and test that it works.
				Then copy that to grub.cfg once you're satisfied.
				WHY? BECAUSE AN INCORRECTLY SET PASSWORD CONFIG MEANS YOU CAN'T AUTHENTICATE, WHICH MEANS 'BRICK'.
			</p>
			<p>
				(emphasis added, because it's needed. This is a common roadblock for users)
			</p>

			<p>
				Obviously, replace it with the correct hash that you actually got for the password that you entered. Meaning, not the hash that you see above!
			</p>

			<p>
				After this, you will have a modified ROM with the menu entry for cryptomount, and the entry before that for the GRUB password. Flash the modified ROM 
				using <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom">this tutorial</a>.

		<h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>

			<p>
				A user reported issues when booting with a docking station attached
				on an X200, when decrypting the disk in GRUB. The error
				<i>AHCI transfer timed out</i> was observed. The workaround
				was to remove the docking station.
			</p>

			<p>
				Further investigation revealed that it was the DVD drive causing problems.
				Removing that worked around the issue.
