		<h1>About the libreboot project</h1>

			<p>
				GNU Libreboot is a free BIOS or UEFI replacement (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free as in freedom</a>);
				libre <em>boot firmware</em> that initializes the hardware and starts a bootloader for your operating
				system.
				It's also an open source BIOS, but open source <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">fails</a> to
				promote freedom; <em>please call libreboot <strong><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a></strong></em>.
                Since 14 May 2016, Libreboot is part of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Libreboot originally began during December 2013, as a commercial effort
				by the <a href="https://minifree.org">Ministry of Freedom</a> to achieve
				<a href="https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/respects-your-freedom">RYF</a> endorsement for a modified ThinkPad X60
				(the first system to ever be added to libreboot).
			</p>

			<p>
				Back then, the name <i>libreboot</i> didn't exist; the project was nameless,
				referring to itself as a <i>deblobbed version of coreboot</i>. The project named
				itself libreboot at some point during early 2014, and has since rapidly expanded
				to support more hardware and become more user-friendly.
			</p>

			<p>
				Libreboot is a <a href="http://coreboot.org/">coreboot</a> distribution (distro) with proprietary software removed,
				intended to be a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free</a>
				(libre) 'BIOS' replacement for your computer. The project is aimed at users, attempting to make
				coreboot as easy to use as possible. 
				Read the full <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software definition</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Libreboot has many practical advantages over <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/proprietary/">proprietary</a> boot firmware, 
				such as faster boot speeds and better security. You can
				<a href="gnulinux/index.html">install GNU/Linux with encrypted /boot/</a>,
				<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/GRUB2#signed_kernels">verify GPG signatures on your kernel</a>,
				put a kernel in the flash chip and more.
			</p>

			<h2>
				The libreboot project has three main goals:
			</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i><u><b>Recommend and distribute only free software</b></u></i>.
						Coreboot distributes certain pieces of proprietary software which is needed on some systems.
						Examples can include things like CPU microcode updates, memory initialization blobs and so on.
						The coreboot project sometimes recommends adding more blobs which it does not distribute, such
						as the Video BIOS or Intel's <i>Management Engine</i>. However, a lot of dedicated and talented
						individuals in coreboot work hard to replace these blobs whenever possible.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><u><b>Support as much hardware as possible!</b></u></i>
						Libreboot supports less hardware than coreboot, because most systems from coreboot still require
						certain proprietary software to work properly. Libreboot is an attempt to support as much
						hardware as possible, without any proprietary software.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><u><b>Make coreboot easy to use</b></u></i>.
						Coreboot is notoriously difficult to install, due to an overall lack of user-focussed 
						documentation and support. Most people will simply give up before attempting to install coreboot.<br/><br/>
						
						Libreboot attempts to bridge this divide, making sure that everything from building
						to installing coreboot is automated, as much as is feasibly possible. Secondly, the project
						produces documentation aimed at non-technical users. Thirdly, the project attempts
						to provide excellent user support via mailing lists and IRC.<br/><br/>
						
						Libreboot already comes with a payload (GRUB), flashrom and other needed parts. Everything
						is fully integrated, in a way where most of the complicated steps that are otherwise required,
						are instead done for the user in advance.<br/><br/>
						
						You can download ROM images for your libreboot system and install them, without having
						to build anything from source. The build system is also fully automated, so building
						from source is easy if you wanted to do that (for whatever reason).
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>
				Libreboot is a coreboot distribution, not a coreboot fork
			</h2>

				<p>
					Libreboot is not a fork of coreboot. Every so often, the project re-bases on the latest
					version of coreboot, with the number of custom patches in use minimized.
				</p>

				<p>
					All new coreboot development should be done in coreboot (upstream), not libreboot!
					Libreboot is about deblobbing and packaging coreboot in a user-friendly way, where most work
					is already done for the user.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For example, if you wanted to add a new board to libreboot, you should add it to coreboot first.
					Libreboot will automatically receive your code at a later date, when it updates itself.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The deblobbed coreboot tree used in libreboot is referred to as <i>coreboot-libre</i>,
					to distinguish it as a component of <i>libreboot</i>.
				</p>

			<h2>
				Libreboot is a 'stable' version of coreboot
			</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Coreboot uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release">rolling release</a> model,
						which means that it is not guaranteed to be stable, or to even work at all on a given day.
						Coreboot does have a strict code review process, but being such a large project with so many contributors, regressions
						are always possible.
					</li>
					<li>
						Libreboot freezes on a particular revision of coreboot, making sure that everything works properly,
						making fixes on top of that and repeating this during each subsequent update to a later version
						of coreboot. By doing this, it provides a stronger guarantee to the user that the firmware
						will be reliable, and not break their system.
					</li>
				</ul>
