		<h1 id="pagetop">Gigabyte GA-G41M-ES2L desktop board</h1>

		<p>
			This is a desktop board using intel hardware (circa ~2009, ICH7 southbridge, similar performance-wise to the Libreboot X200. It can make for quite a nifty desktop. Powered by libreboot.
		</p>
        <p>
            IDE on the board is untested, but it might be possible to use a SATA HDD using an IDE SATA adapter. The SATA ports do work.
        </p>
		<p>
            The pci-express x16 port currently does not work on this board.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518. To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it from source using the libreboot git repository.</strong>
		</p>
        <p>
            You need to set a custom MAC address in GNU/Linux for the NIC to work. In /etc/network/interfaces on debian-based systems like Trisquel,
            this would be in the entry for your NIC:<br/>
            hwaddress ether macaddressgoeshere
        </p>
