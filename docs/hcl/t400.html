			<p>
				It is believed that all or most T400 laptops are compatible. 
				See notes about <a href="../install/t400_external.html#cpu_compatibility">CPU compatibility</a>
				for potential incompatibilities.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are two possible flash chip sizes for the T400: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). 
				This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB
				is SOIC-16.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>The T400 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it
				by using a modified descriptor: see <a href="gm45_remove_me.html">gm45_remove_me.html</a></b> (contains notes, plus
				instructions)
			</p>

				Flashing instructions can be found at <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom">../install/index.html#flashrom</a>

				<h3 id="hwvirt">Hardware virtualization (vt-x)</h3>
					<p>
						The T400, when run without CPU microcode updates in coreboot, currently kernel panics
						if running QEMU with vt-x enabled on 2 cores for the guest. With a single core enabled
						for the guest, the guest panics (but the host is fine). Working around this in QEMU
						might be possible; if not, software virtualization should work fine (it's just slower).
					</p>
					<p>
						On GM45 hardware (with libreboot), make sure that the <i>kvm</i> and <i>kvm_intel</i> kernel modules
						are not loaded, when using QEMU.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following errata datasheet from Intel might help with investigation:

			The T400 is almost identical to the X200, code-wise. See <a href="x200.html">x200.html</a>.

			The coreboot wiki <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Motherboard_Porting_Guide">shows</a>
			how to collect various logs useful in porting to new
			boards.  Following are outputs from the T400:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				T400 with <b>Winbond W25X64</b> flash chip (8MiB, SOIC-16)
				and Lenovo BIOS 2.02 (EC firmware 1.01):
				<ul>
					<li><a href="../future/dumps/logs-t400-bios2.02-ec1.01/">../future/dumps/logs-t400-bios2.02-ec1.01/</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Version of flashrom used for the external flashing/reading logs is the one that libreboot git revision c164960 uses.
