				'Supported' means that the build scripts know how to build ROM images for these systems,
				and that the systems have been tested (confirmed working). There may be exceptions; 
				in other words, this is a list of 'officially' supported systems.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is also possible to build ROM images (from source) for other systems (and virtual systems, e.g. QEMU).

		<h2 id="t60_ati_intel">ThinkPad T60 (ATI GPU) and ThinkPad T60 (Intel GPU) differences.</h2>

			<p>
				If your T60 is a 14.1&quot; or 15.1&quot; model with an ATI GPU, it won't work with libreboot by default but
				you can replace the motherboard with another T60 motherboard that has an Intel GPU, and then libreboot should work.
			</p>

			<p>
				As far as I know, 14.1&quot; (Intel GPU) and 15.1&quot; (Intel GPU) T60 motherboards are the same, where
				'spacers' are used on the 15.1&quot; T60. In any case, it makes sense to find one that is guaranteed to fit in your chassis.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is also a 15.4&quot; T60 with Intel GPU.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note: the T60<b>p</b> laptops all have ATI graphics. 
				The T60p laptops cannot be used with libreboot under any circumstances.
			</p>

			<p>
				The following T60 motherboard (see area highlighted in white) shows an empty space where the ATI GPU would be (this particular motherboard has an Intel GPU):<br/><br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/t60_unbrick.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				The reason that the ATI GPU on T60 is unsupported is due to the VBIOS (Video BIOS) which is non-free. 
				The VBIOS for the Intel GPU on X60/T60 has been reverse engineered, and replaced with Free Software and
				so will work in libreboot.
			</p>

			<p>
				The 'Video BIOS' is what initializes graphics.
			</p>

			<p>
				See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_BIOS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_BIOS</a>.<br/>
				In fact, lack of free VBIOS in general is a big problem in coreboot, and is one reason (among others) why many ports for coreboot are 
				unsuitable for libreboot's purpose.
			</p>

			<p>
				Theoretically, the ThinkPad T60 with ATI GPU can work with libreboot and have ROM images compiled for it, however
				in practise it would not be usable as a laptop because there would be no visual display at all. That being said,
				such a configuration is acceptable for use in a 'headless' server setup (with serial and/or ssh console as the display).

				There is an Apple laptop called the macbook1,1 from 2006 which uses the same i945 chipset as the ThinkPad X60/T60.

				You can refer to <a href="#macbook21">#macbook21</a> for most of this. Macbook2,1 laptops come with Core 2 Duo processors

						The bootloader will detect the GNU/Linux CD as 'Windows' (because Apple doesn't think GNU/Linux exists). Install it like you normally would.
						When you boot up again, hold Alt/Control once more. The installation (on the HDD) will once again be seen as 'Windows'. (it's not actually Windows,
						but Apple likes to think that Apple and Microsoft are all that exist.)
						Now to install libreboot, follow <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom_macbook21">../install/index.html#flashrom_macbook21</a>.

				You need to replace OS X with GNU/Linux before flashing libreboot. (OSX won't run at all in libreboot).
			</p>

			<p>
				There are some issues with this system (compared to other computers that libreboot supports):
			</p>

			<p>
				This is an apple laptop, so it comes with OS X: it has an Apple keyboard, which means that certain keys are missing:
				insert, del, home, end, pgup, pgdown. There is also one mouse button only. Battery life is poor compared to X60/T60 (for now). 
				It also has other issues: for example, the Apple logo on the back is a hole, exposing the backlight, which means that it glows. You should cover it up.
			</p>

			<p>
				The system does get a bit hotter compared to when running the original firmware. It is certainly hotter
				than an X60/T60. The heat issues have been partially fixed by the following patch (now merged in libreboot):
				<a href="http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/7923/">http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/7923/</a>.

					The MacBook2,1 comes with a webcam, which does not work without proprietary software. Also, webcams are a security risk; cover it up! Or remove it.

				A user reported that they could get better response from the touchpad with the following in their xorg.conf:
			</p>

<pre>
Section "InputClass"
 Identifier "Synaptics Touchpad"
 Driver "synaptics"
 MatchIsTouchpad "on"
 MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
 Driver "synaptics"
# The next two values determine how much pressure one needs
# for tapping, moving the cursor and other events.
 Option "FingerLow" "10"
 Option "FingerHigh" "15"
# Do not emulate mouse buttons in the touchpad corners.
 Option "RTCornerButton" "0"
 Option "RBCornerButton" "0"
 Option "LTCornerButton" "0"
 Option "LBCornerButton" "0"
# One finger tap = left-click
 Option "TapButton1" "1"
# Two fingers tap = right-click
 Option "TapButton2" "3"
# Three fingers tap = middle-mouse
 Option "TapButton3" "2"
# Try to not count the palm of the hand landing on the touchpad
# as a tap. Not sure if helps.
 Option "PalmDetect" "1"
# The following modifies how long and how fast scrolling continues
# after lifting the finger when scrolling
 Option "CoastingSpeed" "20"
 Option "CoastingFriction" "200"
# Smaller number means that the finger has to travel less distance
# for it to count as cursor movement. Larger number prevents cursor
# shaking.
 Option "HorizHysteresis" "10"
 Option "VertHysteresis" "10"
# Prevent two-finger scrolling. Very jerky movement
 Option "HorizTwoFingerScroll" "0"
 Option "VertTwoFingerScroll" "0"
# Use edge scrolling
 Option "HorizEdgeScroll" "1"
 Option "VertEdgeScroll" "1"
EndSection

			<p>
				A user reported that the above is only for linux kernel 3.15 or lower. For newer kernels,
				the touchpad works fine out of the box, except middle tapping.
			</p>

			<p>
				A user submitted a utility to enable 3-finger tap on this laptop. It's
				available at <i>resources/utilities/macbook21-three-finger-tap</i> in
				the libreboot git repository. The script is for GNOME, confirmed to
				work in Trisquel 7.
