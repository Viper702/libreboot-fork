		<h1 id="pagetop">GM45 chipsets: remove the ME (manageability engine)</h1>
			<p>
				This sections relates to disabling and removing the ME (Intel <b>M</b>anagement <b>E</b>ngine) on
				GM45. This was originally done on the ThinkPad X200, and later adapted for the ThinkPad R400/T400/T500. It can
				in principle be done on any GM45 or GS45 system.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ME is a blob that typically must be left inside the flash chip (in the ME region, as outlined
				by the default descriptor). On GM45, it is possible to remove it without any ill effects. All
				other parts of coreboot on GM45 systems (provided GMA MHD4500 / Intel graphics) can be blob-free,
				so removing the ME was the last obstacle to
				make GM45 a feasible target in libreboot (the systems can also work without the microcode blobs). 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ME is removed and disabled in libreboot by modifying the descriptor. More info about
				this can be found in the ich9deblob/ich9gen source code in resources/utilities/ich9deblob/
				in libreboot, or more generally on this page.
			</p>
			<p>
				More information about the ME can be found at
				<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Intel_Management_Engine">http://www.coreboot.org/Intel_Management_Engine</a>
				and <a href="http://me.bios.io/Main_Page">http://me.bios.io/Main_Page</a>.

		<h1 id="ich9gen">ICH9 gen utility</h1>
		
			<p>
				It is no longer necessary to use <a href="#ich9deblob">ich9deblob</a> to generate
				a deblobbed descriptor+gbe image for GM45 targets. ich9gen is a small utility within
				ich9deblob that can generate them from scratch, without a factory.bin dump.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				ich9gen executables can be found under ./ich9deblob/ statically compiled in
				libreboot_util. If you are using src or git, build ich9gen from source with:<br/>
				$ <b>./build module ich9deblob</b><br/>
				The executable will appear under resources/utilities/ich9deblob/
			</p>
				
			<p>
				Run:<br/>
				$ <b>./ich9gen</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Running ich9gen this way (without any arguments) generates
				a default descriptor+gbe image with a generic MAC address.
				You probably don't want to use the generic one; the ROM images
				in libreboot contain a descriptor+gbe image by default (already
				inserted) just to prevent or mitigate the risk of bricking
				your laptop, but with the generic MAC address (the libreboot
				project does not know what your real MAC address is).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You can find out your MAC address from <b>ip addr</b> or <b>ifconfig</b> in GNU/Linux. 
				Alternatively, if you are running libreboot already (with the correct MAC address in your
				ROM), dump it (flashrom -r) and read the first 6 bytes from position 0x1000 (or 0x2000) in a hex editor
				(or, rename it to factory.rom and run it in ich9deblob: in the newly created mkgbe.c
				will be the individual bytes of your MAC address). If you are currently running the stock firmware
				and haven't installed libreboot yet, you can also run that through ich9deblob to get the mac address.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				An even simpler way to get the MAC address would be to read what's on the little sticker on
				the bottom/base of the laptop.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				On GM45 laptops that use flash descriptors, the MAC address
				or the onboard ethernet chipset is flashed (inside the ROM image).
				You should generate a descriptor+gbe image with your own MAC address
				inside (with the Gbe checksum updated to match). Run:<br/>
				$ <b>./ich9gen --macaddress XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX</b><br/>
				(replace the XX chars with the hexadecimal chars in the MAC address that you want)
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Two new files will be created:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>ich9fdgbe_4m.bin</b>: this is for GM45 laptops with the 4MB flash chip.</li>
					<li><b>ich9fdgbe_8m.bin</b>: this is for GM45 laptops with the 8MB flash chip.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>
				Two other files will also be created, for the ThinkPad R500 which has a different NIC and, therefore,
				no GbE region (for this laptop, it is not necessary to change the MAC address in the flash chip, because
				it's burned into the NIC):
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>ich9fdnogbe_4m.bin</b>: this is for ThinkPad R500 laptops with the 4MB flash chip, where no GbE region is to be defined.</li>
					<li><b>ich9fdnogbe_8m.bin</b>: this is for ThinkPad R500 laptops with the 8MB flash chip, where no GbE region is to be defined
					- <b>NOTE: No actual R500 laptops with 8MiB are believed to exist. It is believed, that all R500 laptops have 4MiB flash chips</b>.</li>
				</ul>
			
			<p>
				Assuming that your libreboot image is named <b>libreboot.rom</b>, copy
				the file to where <b>libreboot.rom</b> is located
				and then insert the descriptor+gbe file into the ROM image. For 8MiB flash chips:<br/>
				$ <b>dd if=ich9fdgbe_8m.bin of=libreboot.rom bs=1 count=12k conv=notrunc</b><br/>
				For 4MiB flash chips:<br/>
				$ <b>dd if=ich9fdgbe_4m.bin of=libreboot.rom bs=1 count=12k conv=notrunc</b><br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>For the ThinkPad R500, do this instead:</b><br/>
				For 8MiB flash chips (<b>highly unlikely on the ThinkPad R500)</b>:<br/>
				$ <b>dd if=ich9fdnogbe_8m.bin of=libreboot.rom bs=1 count=4k conv=notrunc</b><br/>
				For 4MiB flash chips (<b>You probably have this)</b>:<br/>
				$ <b>dd if=ich9fdnogbe_4m.bin of=libreboot.rom bs=1 count=4k conv=notrunc</b><br/>
				NOTE: This shouldn't be necessary. Libreboot ROM images already contain a descriptor embedded inside
				the ROM images for GM45, generated by the ich9gen utility. It's only desirable to re-insert your own
				when changing the MAC address, which is unnecessary (actually impossible) on the R500, because on that laptop,
				as already stated, the NIC already has the correct MAC address burned in, along with along configuration data.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Your libreboot.rom image is now ready to be flashed on the system. Refer back to 
				<a href="../install/index.html#flashrom">../install/index.html#flashrom</a>
				for how to flash it.

				Write-protecting the flash chip
			</h2>
				<p>
					Look in <i>resources/utilities/ich9deblob/src/descriptor/descriptor.c</i>
					for the following lines in the <i>descriptorHostRegionsUnlocked</i> function:
				</p>
<pre>
   descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.fdRegionWriteAccess = 0x1;
   descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.biosRegionWriteAccess = 0x1;
   descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.meRegionWriteAccess = 0x1;
   descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.gbeRegionWriteAccess = 0x1;
   descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.pdRegionWriteAccess = 0x1;
</pre>
				<p>
					Also look in <i>resources/utilities/ich9deblob/src/ich9gen/mkdescriptor.c</i>
					for the following lines:
				</p>
<pre>
    descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.fdRegionWriteAccess = 0x1; /* see ../descriptor/descriptor.c */
    descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.biosRegionWriteAccess = 0x1; /* see ../descriptor/descriptor.c */
    descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.meRegionWriteAccess = 0x1; /* see ../descriptor/descriptor.c */
    descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.gbeRegionWriteAccess = 0x1; /* see ../descriptor/descriptor.c */
    descriptorStruct.masterAccessSection.flMstr1.pdRegionWriteAccess = 0x1; /* see ../descriptor/descriptor.c */
</pre>

				<p style="font-size:2em;">
					NOTE: When you write-protect the flash chip, re-flashing is no longer possible unless you
					use dedicated external equipment, which also means disassembling the laptop. The same equipment
					can also be used to remove the write-protection later on, if you choose to do so. *Only* write-protect
					the chip if you have the right equipment for external flashing later on; for example, see
					<a href="../install/bbb_setup.html">../install/bbb_setup.html</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Change them all to 0x0, then re-compile ich9gen. After you have done that,
					follow the notes in <a href="#ich9gen">#ich9gen</a> to generate a new
					descriptor+gbe image and insert that into your ROM image, then flash it.
					The next time you boot, the flash chip will be read-only in software
					(hardware re-flashing will still work, which you will need for re-flashing
					the chip after write-protecting it, to clear the write protection or
					to flash yet another ROM image with write protection set in the descriptor).
				</p>
				<p>
					Flashrom will tell you that you can still forcefully re-flash, using <i>-p internal:ich_spi_force=yes</i> but
					this won't actually work; it'll just brick your laptop.
				</p>
				<p>

		<h1 id="ich9deblob">ICH9 deblob utility</h1>
		
			<p>
				<b>This is no longer strictly necessary. Libreboot ROM images for GM45 systems now
				contain the 12KiB descriptor+gbe generated from ich9gen, by default.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This was the tool originally used to disable the ME on X200 (later adapted for other systems that use the
				GM45 chipset). <a href="#ich9gen">ich9gen</a> now supersedes it;
				ich9gen is better because it does not rely on dumping the factory.rom image (whereas, ich9deblob does).
			</p>
		
			<p>
				This is what you will use to generate the deblobbed descriptor+gbe regions for your libreboot ROM image.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are working with libreboot_src (or git), you can find the source under resources/utilities/ich9deblob/
				and will already be compiled if you ran <b>./build module all</b> or <b>./build module ich9deblob</b> from the main directory (./), 
				otherwise you can build it like so:<br/>
				$ <b>./build module ich9deblob</b><br/>
				An executable file named <b>ich9deblob</b> will now appear under resources/utilities/ich9deblob/
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are working with libreboot_util release archive, you can find the utility included, statically compiled
				(for i686 and x86_64 on GNU/Linux) under ./ich9deblob/.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Place the factory.rom from your system 
				(can be obtained using the external flashing guides for GM45 targets linked <a href="../install/index.html">../install/index.html</a>) in
				the directory where you have your ich9deblob executable, then run the tool:<br/>
				$ <b>./ich9deblob</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				A 12kiB file named <b>deblobbed_descriptor.bin</b> will now appear. <b>Keep this and the factory.rom stored in a safe location!</b>
				The first 4KiB contains the descriptor data region for your system, and the next 8KiB contains the gbe region (config data for your
				gigabit NIC). These 2 regions could actually be separate files, but they are joined into 1 file in this case.
			</p>
			<p>
				A 4KiB file named <b>deblobbed_4kdescriptor.bin</b> will alternatively appear, if no GbE region was detected inside the ROM image.
				This is usually the case, when a discrete NIC is used (eg Broadcom) instead of Intel. Only the Intel NICs need a GbE region in
				the flash chip.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Assuming that your libreboot image is named <b>libreboot.rom</b>, copy
				the <b>deblobbed_descriptor.bin</b> file to where <b>libreboot.rom</b> is located
				and then run:<br/>
				$ <b>dd if=deblobbed_descriptor.bin of=libreboot.rom bs=1 count=12k conv=notrunc</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively, if you got a the <b>deblobbed_4kdescriptor.bin</b> file (no GbE defined),
				do this:
				$ <b>dd if=deblobbed_4kdescriptor.bin of=libreboot.rom bs=1 count=4k conv=notrunc</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The utility will also generate 4 additional files:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>mkdescriptor.c</li>
					<li>mkdescriptor.h</li>
					<li>mkgbe.c</li>
					<li>mkgbe.h</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				These are C source files that can re-generate the very same Gbe and Descriptor structs
				(from ich9deblob/ich9gen). To use these, place them in src/ich9gen/ in ich9deblob, then re-build. 
				The newly built <b>ich9gen</b> executable will be able to re-create the very same 12KiB file from scratch,
				based on the C structs, this time <b>without</b> the need for a factory.rom dump!
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You should now have a <b>libreboot.rom</b> image containing the correct 4K descriptor and 8K gbe regions, which
				will then be safe to flash. Refer back to <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom">../install/index.html#flashrom</a>
				for how to flash it.
			</p>

	<div class="section">

		<h1 id="demefactory">demefactory utility</h1>

			<p>
				This takes a factory.rom dump and disables the ME/TPM, but leaves the region intact.
				It also sets all regions read-write.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The ME interferes with flash read/write in flashrom, and the default descriptor
				locks some regions. The idea is that doing this will remove all of those restrictions.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Simply run (with factory.rom in the same directory):<br/>
				$ <b>./demefactory</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It will generate a 4KiB descriptor file (only the descriptor, no GbE). Insert that into
				a factory.rom image (NOTE: do this on a copy of it. Keep the original factory.rom stored
				safely somewhere):<br/>
				$ <b>dd if=demefactory_4kdescriptor.bin of=factory_nome.rom bs=1 count=4k conv=notrunc</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				TODO: test this.<br/>
				TODO: lenovobios (GM45 thinkpads) still write-protects parts of the flash. Modify the assembly code
				inside.
				Note: the factory.rom (BIOS region) from lenovobios is in a compressed format, which you have to extract.
				bios_extract upstream won't work, but the following was said in #coreboot on freenode IRC:
			</p>
<pre>
&lt;roxfan&gt; fchmmr: try bios_extract with ffv patch <a href="http://patchwork.coreboot.org/patch/3444/">http://patchwork.coreboot.org/patch/3444/</a>
&lt;roxfan&gt; or <a href="https://github.com/coreboot/bios_extract/blob/master/phoenix_extract.py">https://github.com/coreboot/bios_extract/blob/master/phoenix_extract.py</a>
&lt;roxfan&gt; what are you looking for specifically, btw?

0x74: 0x9fff03e0 PR0: Warning: 0x003e0000-0x01ffffff is read-only.
0x84: 0x81ff81f8 PR4: Warning: 0x001f8000-0x001fffff is locked.
</pre>

			<p>
				Use-case: a factory.rom image modified in this way would theoretically have no
				flash protections whatsoever, making it easy to quickly switch between factory/libreboot
				in software, without ever having to disassemble and re-flash externally unless you brick
				the device.

			The first part is the MAC address set to all 0x1F. It's repeated haly way through
			the 8K area, and the rest is all 0xFF. This is all documented in the datasheet.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The GBe region starts at 0x20A000 bytes from the *end* of a factory image and is 0x2000 bytes long.
			In libreboot (deblobbed) the descriptor is set to put gbe directly after the initial 4K flash descriptor. 
			So the first 4K of the ROM is the descriptor, and then the next 8K is the gbe region.

					According to the datasheet, it's supposed to add up to 0xBABA but can actually be others on the X200.
					<a href="https://communities.intel.com/community/wired/blog/2010/10/14/how-to-basic-eeprom-checksums">https://communities.intel.com/community/wired/blog/2010/10/14/how-to-basic-eeprom-checksums</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>&quot;One of those engineers loves classic rock music, so he selected 0xBABA&quot;</i>
				</p>
				<p>In honour of the song <i>Baba O'Reilly</i> by <i>The Who</i> apparently. We're not making this stuff up...</p>

				<p>
					0x3ABA, 0x34BA, 0x40BA and more have been observed in the main Gbe regions on the X200 factory.rom dumps.
					The checksums of the backup regions match BABA, however. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					By default, the X200 (as shipped by Lenovo) actually has an invalid main gbe checksum. The backup gbe region is correct,
					and is what these systems default to. Basically, you should do what you need on the *backup* gbe region, and
					then correct the main one by copying from the backup.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Look at resources/utilities/ich9deblob/ich9deblob.c.
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Add the first 0x3F 16bit numbers (unsigned) of the GBe descriptor together (this includes the checksum value)
						and that has to add up to 0xBABA. In other words, the checksum is 0xBABA minus the total of the first
						0x3E 16bit numbers (unsigned), ignoring any overflow.</li>

				<a href="http://www.intel.co.uk/content/dam/doc/datasheet/io-controller-hub-9-datasheet.pdf">http://www.intel.co.uk/content/dam/doc/datasheet/io-controller-hub-9-datasheet.pdf</a>
				from page 850 onwards. This explains everything that is in the flash descriptor, which can be used to understand what libreboot
				is doing about modifying it.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				How to deblob:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>patch the number of regions present in the descriptor from 5 - 3</li>
					<li>originally descriptor + bios + me + gbe + platform</li>
					<li>modified = descriptor + bios + gbe</li>
					<li>the next stage is to patch the part of the descriptor which defines the start and end point of each section</li>
					<li>then cut out the gbe region and insert it just after the region</li>
					<li>all this can be substantiated with public docs (ICH9 datasheet)</li>
					<li>the final part is flipping 2 bits. Halting the ME via 1 MCH soft strap and 1 ICH soft strap</li>
					<li>the part of the descriptor described there gives the base address and length of each region (bits 12:24 of each address)</li>
					<li>to disable a region, you set the base address to 0xFFF and the length to 0</li>
					<li>and you change the number of regions from 4 (zero based) to 2</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p>
				There's an interesting parameter called 'ME Alternate disable', which allows the ME to only handle hardware errata in the southbridge,
				but disables any other functionality. This is similar to the 'ignition' in the 5 series and higher but using the standard firmware
				instead of a small 128K version. Useless for libreboot, though.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				To deblob GM45, you chop out the platform and ME regions and correct the addresses in flReg1-4.
				Then you set meDisable to 1 in ICHSTRAP0 and MCHSTRAP0.
			</p>
				
			<p>How to patch the descriptor from the factory.rom dump</p>
				<ul>
					<li>map the first 4k into the struct (minus the gbe region)</li>
					<li>set NR in FLMAP0 to 2 (from 4)</li>
					<li>adjust BASE and LIMIT in flReg1,2,3,4 to reflect the new location of each region (or remove them in the case of Platform and ME)</li>
					<li>set meDisable to 1/true in ICHSTRAP0 and MCHSTRAP0</li>
					<li>extract the 8k GBe region and append that to the end of the 4k descriptor</li>
					<li>output the 12k concatenated chunk</li>
					<li>Then it can be dd'd into the first 12K part of a coreboot image.</li>
					<li>the GBe region always starts 0x20A000 bytes from the end of the ROM</li>
				</ul>
					
			<p>
				This means that libreboot's descriptor region will simply define the following regions:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>descriptor (4K)</li>
					<li>gbe (8K)</li>
					<li>bios (rest of flash chip. CBFS also set to occupy this whole size)</li>
				</ul>

			<p>
				The data in the descriptor region is little endian, and it represents bits 24:12 of the address
				(bits 12-24, written this way since bit 24 is nearer to left than bit 12 in the binary representation).
			</p>
			<p>
				So, <i>x &lt;&lt; 12 = address</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				If it's in descriptor mode, then the first 4 bytes will be 5A A5 F0 0F.

			<p>
				Basically useless for libreboot, since it appears to be a blob.
				Removing it didn't cause any issues in libreboot.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a 32K region from the factory image. It could be data
				(non-functional) that the original Lenovo BIOS used, but we don't know.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				It has only a 448 byte fragment different from 0x00 or 0xFF.
