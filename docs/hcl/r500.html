				It is believed that all or most R500 laptops are compatible. 
				See notes about <a href="../install/r500_external.html#cpu_compatibility">CPU compatibility</a> for
				potential incompatibilities.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are two possible flash chip sizes for the R500: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). 
				This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB
				is SOIC-16.
				<b>
					NOTE: this paragraph is being treated with contempt. When an R500 was disassembled, it didn't look
					like there was an extra place for SOIC-16. It's highly likely that these laptops only have SOIC-8 (4MiB)
					flash chips. For now, libreboot will distribute 8MiB images just in case. If it is found later on
					that no 8MiB (SOIC-16) chips exist on the R500, then libreboot will cease to distribute 8MiB ROM images
					for this laptop. It is only said that the R500 has 4MiB or 8MiB, for now, since this is the case
					on other GM45 thinkpads that are supported in libreboot.
				</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>The R400 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it
				by using a modified descriptor: see <a href="gm45_remove_me.html">gm45_remove_me.html</a></b> (contains notes, plus
				instructions)

				<h3 id="hwvirt">Hardware virtualization (vt-x)</h3>
					<p>
						The R400, when run without CPU microcode updates in coreboot, currently kernel panics
						if running QEMU with vt-x enabled on 2 cores for the guest. With a single core enabled
						for the guest, the guest panics (but the host is fine). Working around this in QEMU
						might be possible; if not, software virtualization should work fine (it's just slower).
					</p>
					<p>
						On GM45 hardware (with libreboot), make sure that the <i>kvm</i> and <i>kvm_intel</i> kernel modules
						are not loaded, when using QEMU.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following errata datasheet from Intel might help with investigation:

				False report of overheating, automatic shut down
			</h2>
				<p>
					When attempting to boot Trisquel 7 live USB (GNOME), the following error appears and then
					the system abruptly shuts down:
					<b>thermal thermal_zone1: critical temperature reached(120 C),shutting down</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is false. When booting with <b>acpi=off</b>, xsensors shows no overheating during a stress test.
					The system does not feel hot, nor does anything smell like it's burning.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is most likely caused by an ACPI bug in coreboot, which will have to be investigated. Grep for those things,
					comparing factory/libreboot (iasl -d or acpidump):
				</p>
<pre>
 Return (C2K(\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.TMP0))
TMP0, 8,        /* Thermal Zone 0 temperature */
</pre>
			<h2>Cardbus slot didn't work when tested</h2>
				<p>
					Investigate.

		<h1>Descriptor differences</h1>

			<p>
				The <i>ich9gen</i> and <i>ich9deblob</i> utilities were modified,
				to reflect these differences.
			</p>

			<h2>Component 1 Density</h2>

<pre>
-    descriptorStruct.componentSection.flcomp.component1Density = 0x4;
+    descriptorStruct.componentSection.flcomp.component1Density = 0x3;
</pre>

				<p>
					Read page 848 in the ICH9 datasheet, linked to from <a href="gm45_remove_me.html#flash_descriptor_region">gm45_remove_me.html#flash_descriptor_region</a>.
					This doesn't break anything, but in the process of debugging descriptor differences on the R500, it was found that this
					config option isn't being modified in libreboot, for different size ROM images. 4MiB ROM images still contain 0x4 for component1Density.
					Per datasheets, 0x4 (100) is 8MiB, and 0x3 (011) is 4MiB. <b>This should be fixed!</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					It was 0x3 for this test, because the R500 that was used to create this report
					had a 4MiB SOIC-8 flash chip.
				</p>

			<h2>flReg1.LIMIT</h2>

<pre>
-    /* descriptorStruct.regionSection.flReg1.LIMIT = 0x07ff; */
+    /* descriptorStruct.regionSection.flReg1.LIMIT = 0x03ff; */
</pre>

				<p>
					Ignore this. This is not used at all, and is instead automatically set, depending on
					the targetted ROM image size, both in ich9gen and ich9deblob. 0x7ff means 8MiB, and 0x3ff means 
					4MiB. flReg1 is for the BIOS region. Simply speaking, this is defining the final 4KiB section
					of the ROM image, where the BIOS region ends.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was 0x3ff for this test, because the R500 that was used to create this report
					had a 4MiB SOIC-8 flash chip.
				</p>

			<h2>Onboard gigabit ethernet NIC is disabled</h2>

<pre>
-    descriptorStruct.ichStraps.ichStrap0.integratedGbe = 0x1;
-    descriptorStruct.ichStraps.ichStrap0.lanPhy = 0x1;
+    descriptorStruct.ichStraps.ichStrap0.integratedGbe = 0x0;
+    descriptorStruct.ichStraps.ichStrap0.lanPhy = 0x0;
</pre>

				<p>
					Most GM45 laptops (e.g. X200, T400, T500, R400) have the <b>Intel 82567LM</b>
					integrated gigabit NIC.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the R500, a <b>Broadcom BCM5787M</b> NIC is present. To make this work,
					the change above must be made for the R500 descriptor.
				</p>

		<h1 id="nogbe">No Gbe region!</h1>

			<p>
				Not shown in the diffs above:
			</p>

<pre>
Original: Descriptor start block: 00000000 ; Descriptor end block: 00000000
Original: BIOS start block: 00200000 ; BIOS end block: 003ff000
Original: ME start block: 00001000 ; ME end block: 001f7000
Original: GBe start block: 00fff000 ; GBe end block: 00000000
Original: Platform start block: 001f8000 ; Platform end block: 001ff000
</pre>

			<p>
				As explained above, this laptop uses a Broadcom NIC, which means that
				the Gbe region does not and <i>should not</i> exist, since this is for the
				Intel NIC only.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the output above, Gbe starts at fff and ends at 000. Base 1FFF or FFF, and limit 0,
				means that the region is disabled.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the output above, the ME region is 4KiB larger than on other GM45 systems that have
				a Gbe region. This accounts for the lack of a Gbe region.
			</p>

			<p>
				As part of this effort, ich9gen/ich9deblob/demefactory will all be
				modified to account for the differences above.
			</p>
