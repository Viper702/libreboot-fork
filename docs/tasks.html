					Coreboot (upstream) is adopting a new release model. See 
					<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2015-July/080120.html">http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2015-July/080120.html</a>
					- TODO: think about how this affects libreboot, and see what can be done to make effective use of this policy change.

					Someone linked to
					<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=XGI-Coreboot-FB-Port">this news post</a>
					about a PCI-E graphics card for which a free VBIOS replacement exists. This card uses the same
					chipset as the onboard GPU in the ASUS KFSN4-DRE mainboard, which is already supported in libreboot.
					This graphics card will allow certain desktop motherboards to be viable in libreboot.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/4/172">patch for linux (kernel) to add coreboot framebuffer support</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Libreboot has so far been biased towards Intel. This needs to end (the sooner, the better). A nice start:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>ASUS KGPE-D16</b>: this is a very modern board. It has support for both Fam10h and Fam15h AMD CPUs. The board is still
							new, and still in production. See
							these coreboot mailing list posts:<br/>
							<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2015-April/079773.html">post 1</a> and
							<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2015-April/079773.html">post 2</a><br/><br/>
							
							The board is fully functional (blobs not required), and will be an instant addition to libreboot.
							See <a href="https://raptorengineeringinc.com/coreboot/kgpe-d16-status.php">https://raptorengineeringinc.com/coreboot/kgpe-d16-status.php</a><br/><br/>
							
							<a href="http://raptorengineeringinc.com/content/base/main.htm">Raptor Engineering Inc</a> (USA) has ported
							this board to coreboot, and is using the port internally on their computing cluster, for
							the research that they do. This is the same company that ported 
							the <a href="hcl/kfsn4-dre.html">ASUS KFSN4-DRE</a> which is supported in libreboot.
							The owner (and the
							person who ported the board to coreboot), Timothy Pearson (tpearson on freenode IRC) has reached out to the community,
							in request for funding. This funding will pay for the many months of work (at least 4-5 months, for over 10000 
							lines of code any many patches that will need to be split up) to get the code
							upstreamed into coreboot. This is not as simple as just releasing the code; coreboot has a very strict code
							review process (in place to ensure quality control). The patches will have to be split up, with people's
							concerns and comments addressed over a long period, with patches constantly rebased to keep up with the
							latest coreboot master branch. In order to get this done in a decent enough time frame, Raptor Engineering will need
							to work on a more-or-less full-time basis. The funding amounts that he has asked for, are as follows:
							<ul>
								<li>35K USD - This pays for basic support (Fam10h), plus upstreaming. Minifree Ltd (Francis Rowe's company, sometimes known as Gluglug) will pay for this.</li>
								<li>
									The following will be crowd-funded:<br/>
									15K USD - pays for S3 (suspend/resume), stable text-mode graphics initialization and Fam15h CPU support
									<ul>
										<li>20K USD stretch goal - upstreaming (crowd funded)</li>
									</ul>
									Excess funding from the crowd funding campaign (when started) will be used to subsidize Minifree's costs, and will support the libreboot project.
								</li>
							</ul>
							Although Raptor would be working for many months to get this upstreamed (merged in coreboot's master branch
							in the git repository), libreboot would merge it more or less instantly, probably in the same week that the
							code is released for review. Raptor would also of course be rebasing the patches on a regular basis, as part
							of the review process, so even if it takes longer for the patches to be merged in coreboot, libreboot would have
							support for this board.<br/><br/>
							
							This is a <b>very</b> high-end board, making for a powerful server or workstation (desktop) system
							that should easily be more than powerful enough for almost everyone. Timothy has replaced the AGESA
							source in coreboot with native initialization code for AMD. The work that he has done can easily be
							extended to support more hardware, so getting this code out and upstreamed is very important.<br/><br/>
							
							Francis Rowe (lead developer of libreboot) is working with Timothy to get a crowd funding campaign started,
							and trying to get as many people as possible interested in pledging towards the campaign.<br/><br/>
							
							If you are interested in donating towards the campaign (once it begins), register your interest by contacting
							Francis Rowe, using the information on the <a href="../contrib/">maintainers page</a>.

									TYAN S8230 is very similar, and could probably be ported based on the KGPE-D16. Same GPU too.
									<a href="http://tyan.com/product_SKU_spec.aspx?ProductType=MB&pid=665&SKU=600000194">http://tyan.com/product_SKU_spec.aspx?ProductType=MB&amp;pid=665&amp;SKU=600000194</a>
									<ul>
										<li>
											W83627 (SuperIO) might have a public datasheet.
											Board-specific wiring (PCI interrupts, DIMM voltage selection). etc.
											Board seems to use socketed SOIC-8 SPI flash according to tpearson, based on photos available online - looks like a ZIF socket or something else, a clip retaining the chip.
										</li>
										<li>
											tpearson says: Tyan seems to have done the same thing as Asus did and built a whole lot of custom power control circuitry out of FETs.
											According to him, this will take much effort to reverse engineer.
										</li>
										<li>
											IPMI firmware is non-free but optional (for iKVM feature, remote management like Intel ME).  Not sure if add-on module or baked in.
											In either case, it might be removed or otherwise excluded because it's a HUGE backdoor. Unlike Intel ME, this isn't signed so can be
											removed, and also replaced theoretically. Is the protocol standard public? If so, might be easy/feasible to replace with free code.
											<a href="https://github.com/facebook/openbmc">https://github.com/facebook/openbmc</a> - also linked from
											<a href="https://raptorengineeringinc.com/coreboot/kgpe-d16-status.php">https://raptorengineeringinc.com/coreboot/kgpe-d16-status.php</a>
											- might be possible adapt this.
											- You
											 might need to use the vendor tools running from under the proprietary BIOS to wipe the Flash chip holding the IPMI firmware,
											 if it's baked in. (on KGPE-D16, it's an <a href="http://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ASUS-ASMB6-iKVM-Module.png">add-on card</a> so just don't add the add-on card - also SOIC-16 according to tpearson. but not sure what form factor used on S8230 - it better not be bl***y WSON).
										</li>
										<li>
											SAS controller requires firmware, but optional. (same thing on KGPE-D16). Board also has SATA, so it's fine.
											NOTE: SAS firmware is already flashed onto the SAS controller, to a dedicated chip. Not uploaded/handled by coreboot or linux kernel.
										</li>
										<li>
											tpearson says: power control circuits are a potential issue, not a definite one. it all depends on how Tyan decided to wire things up
											if they engineered things properly, it should actually be transparent.
											ASUS did not, and required work to get it going (see the notes document)

				<li>
					That doesn't mean Intel is off the table just yet:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Intel D510MO motherboard (desktop), pineview chipset. damo22 got raminit working, and is working on finishing the port for coreboot.
							southbridge NM10 (basically rebranded ich7).
							not sure about video init (does it have native graphics initialization?). TODO: review it for libreboot once damo22 pushes
							the code to coreboot for review. damo22 says it should work with several CPUs (Atom D510 D525 N5x etc - but he's unsure). 
							TODO: find other boards similar that could be ported. damo22's one has an Intel Atom D510 CPU.
						</li>
						<li>
							ThinkPad W500: they all use switchable graphics (ATI+Intel). Unknown if PM45 is compatible with GM45.
						</li>
						<li>
							ThinkPad X61: ICH8, i965
							lubko in #coreboot. <a href="https://github.com/lkundrak/coreboot/tree/x61">https://github.com/lkundrak/coreboot/tree/x61</a>
							- raminit still isn't done, there might be other parts that need to be finished (probably EC).
							This system comes with a ME, but it's optional like in GM45, and can be removed.

						</li>
						<li>
							ThinkPad R60, Z61 - probably very similar to X60/T60, with few modifications required
							(probably only the changes based on logs acquired by following
							<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Motherboard_Porting_Guide">http://www.coreboot.org/Motherboard_Porting_Guide</a>)

						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Desktop</b> system: Dell Optiplex 755. There are <b>lots</b> of these available online.
							ICH9. DDR2 RAM (needs work in coreboot). No EC (it's a desktop). It will require
							quite a bit of work in coreboot, but this is a very good candidate.

		<h1>Platform-specific bugs</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Several serious bugs exist on the ThinkPad R500, which makes
					the system virtually unusable. See <a href="hcl/r500/index.html#issues">hcl/r500/index.html#issues</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					GM45: investigate S3/raminit on all models (CPU stepping/cpuid).
					See <a href="hcl/x200.html#ram_s3_microcode">hcl/x200.html#ram_s3_microcode</a>

				</li>
				<li>
					all thinkpads: When the system is running, plugging in an ethernet cable
					doesn't always work (no network), you have to try several times. Booting with
					an ethernet cable attached is reliable. Debug this and fix it.
				</li>
				<li>
					KFSN4-DRE: investigate the 30 second bootblock delay.
					<a href="hcl/kfsn4-dre.html#issues">More info</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					KFSN4-DRE: jittery text-mode graphics.
					<a href="hcl/kfsn4-dre.html#issues">More info</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Fix these issues on GM45/GS45 targets:
					<ul>
						<li>
							X200: text-mode is broken. only framebuffer graphics work. Git-bisect is needed.
						</li>
						<li>
							X60: on the latest coreboot-libre update lately (during June 2015), keyboard works intermittently.
							Bisect and fix.
						</li>
						<li>
							X200/X60: battery drained even while system is "off" on some systems. investigate.
							Could just be the Ethernet controller waiting for a Wake-on-LAN frame.
							'ethtool -s net0 wol d' disables wake on lan until the next boot. There are a lot of ways to make it permanent: netctl. systemd, udev, cron
							- wake on lan was tested, and isn't the issue. It is probably how coreboot handles power off state
							(see the code that handles power_on_after_fail)
						</li>
						<li>
							Sound (internal speaker) broken on T500 (works in lenovobios). external speaker/headphones work.
							- probably a different hda_verb
							- <b>different HDA verbs are now used, test this again</b>
							- worked while system was disassambled, but booted (loose), stopped working when re-assembling. Not sure what's going on here.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fix remaining incompatible LCD panels in native graphics on T500 and T400. 
							See <a href="hcl/gm45_lcd.html">hcl/gm45_lcd.html</a>.
							- EDID related, or difference in how VGA ROM does init. Investigate.
						</li>
						<li>
							T400/T500/R400 (tested on T400): UART (serial port) doesn't work. Investigate.
							(already tried enabling early h8 dock option. some RE with superiotool is needed).
							- kmalkki has an R400. He says he can be contracted for it. (try to DIY first)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Finish all work listed in <a href="future/index.html">future/index.html</a></b>
				</li>
				<li>
					Fix these issues on i945 targets (X60/T60/macbook21)
					<ul>
						<li>
							i945: fix VRAM size (currently 8MB. should be 64MB). 
							See <a href="future/index.html#i945_vram_size">future/index.html#i945_vram_size</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fix remaining incompatible LCD panels in native graphics on T60. 
							See <a href="future/index.html#lcd_i945_incompatibility">future/index.html#lcd_i945_incompatibility</a>.
							- EDID related, or difference in how VGA ROM does init. Investigate.
						</li>
						<li>
							i945: the intel video driver used to initialize the display without native graphics initialization
							and without the extracted video BIOS. It no longer does, so investigate why it does not, and fix
							the regression (fix has to be done in the kernel, Linux).
							See <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2014-June/078104.html">http://www.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2014-June/078104.html</a> and

						</li>
						<li>
							Add fake_vbt tables on i945 systems (also GM45).
						</li>
						<li>
							Commit 26ca08caf81ad2dcc9c8246a743d82ffb464c767 in coreboot, see the while (1) loop that
							waits for the panel to power up on i945. This is an infinite loop if the panel doesn't power up.
							Fix it. Also, are there panels that don't power up? Test this, and fix it.

		<h1>Build system</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Patch the coreboot build system, so that version information is still reliably generated
				(e.g. in the logs), which is currently lacking because libreboot deletes the .git directory
				(because the git history contains the deleted blobs, so libreboot has to delete it). It could
				just be a small patch that hardcodes the coreboot version information, for that coreboot version,
				each time libreboot rebases on a new version of coreboot.<br/><br/>
				patrickg says: francis7: we have you covered: have your libreboot script add a file ".coreboot-version" to the top-level directory, containing the appropriate version number information. that will be used if git describe doesn't work (eg. because .git is missing)

		<h1>Improvements to the utilities</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Make ich9gen/ich9deblob portable. They both rely extensively on bitfields, and they assume
					little-endian; for instance, mapping a little endian file directly to a struct, instead

				<li>
					Make ich9gen/ich9deblob/demefactory show GPL license info via <i>--version</i> argument.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adapt linux-libre deblob scripts for use with coreboot. Libreboot is already deblobbed
					using its own script, but updating it is still a bit too manual. linux-libre's deblob
					scripts do an excellent job and (adapted) will make it much easier to maintain coreboot-libre.

		<h1>Documentation improvements</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Next release after 20150518, relating to the ASUS KFSN4-DRE:
					<ul>
						<li>Remove the notes in docs/release.html that say <i>NOTE: not in libreboot 20150518. Only in git, for now.</i></li>
						<li>Remove the note in docs/hcl/kfsn4-dre.html that says <i> NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518. To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it from source using the libreboot git repository. </i></li>
						<li>Remove the note in docs/hcl/r500.html that says <i> NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518. To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it from source using the libreboot git repository. </i></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Next release after 20150518: note, mention that ACPI brightness methods for X60/T60 work again.
				</li>
				<li>
					Get /proc/ioports for all hw logs. (this was added to Motherboard Porting Guide recently)
					- other instructions were also added there. basically, get whatever extra logs are
					desirable, for all systems.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add info about FTDI 	FT232H usbdebug (BBB could be used for this):
					<a href="http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/10063">http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/10063</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Add information from hw registers on all boards.
					Get them for the following remaining boards: X60, T60, macbook21, R400
				</li>
				<li>
					Add guides for GM45 laptops in docs/security/
				</li>
				<li>
					Add guides for GM45 laptops in docs/hardware/
				</li>
				<li>
					Convert documentation to use Latex (or whatever the GNU project requires) as source.
				</li>
				<li>
					LPC (eg PLCC socket) flashing guide is needed:

					<a href="http://blogs.coreboot.org/files/2013/06/superboosted2.jpg">image</a> - 
					work with mrnuke on getting info about vultureprog PLCC flashing into libreboot. Libreboot needs
					server boards. <a href="https://github.com/mrnuke/vultureprog">https://github.com/mrnuke/vultureprog</a>,

		<h1>Project (institutional) improvements</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Add proper guidelines for contributions,
					like <i>Development Guidelines</i> on the coreboot wiki. For instance, require
					<i>Sign-off-by</i> in all commits for libreboot. Consulting with the FSF about this
					(licensing@fsf.org).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Libreboot needs to be factory firmware, not the replacement. It needs to be *the* firmware.
					Consult with the openlunchbox project (and maybe others) on getting hardware manufactured
					with libreboot support (out of the box, from the factory).</b>
					- rhombus tech might be interesting to contact (also projects like novena, and so on).
					eg <a href="http://rhombus-tech.net/community_ideas/laptop_15in/news/">http://rhombus-tech.net/community_ideas/laptop_15in/news/</a>
					- also see <a href="http://elinux.org/Embedded_Open_Modular_Architecture/EOMA-68">http://elinux.org/Embedded_Open_Modular_Architecture/EOMA-68</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Set up a routine (project-wise) for testing each system with the latest kernel version.
				</li>
				<li>
					Define properly how to maintain libreboot (things to look out for, things to do on a release). It's somewhat
					documented now, but it's not perfect. Delegate tasks (to people that are reliable).
				</li>

		<h1>EC firmware</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Embedded_controller">http://www.coreboot.org/Embedded_controller</a>
				Replace this on all libreboot targets. Some laptops use an extra SPI flash chip for the EC, some
				have EC in the main chip, some don't use SPI flash at all but have the firmware inside the EC chip itself.
				If the EC has integrated flash then you need to be able to get to the pins on the chip or be able to program them over LPC or SPI (if they have that feature).
				The lenovo laptops currently supported in libreboot all use H8 EC chips (contains flash inside the chip).
				Read the datasheets on how to externally flash the EC. Chromebooks seem to have free EC
				(<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/master/chip/">https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/master/chip/</a>).
				- see
				<a href="http://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/2015/05/28/progress-gsoc-week-1/">http://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/2015/05/28/progress-gsoc-week-1/</a> (H8S EC, applies to thinkpads)
