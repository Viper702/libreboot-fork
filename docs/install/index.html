		<h1 id="rom">List of ROM images in libreboot</h1>

			<p>
				Libreboot distributes pre-compiled ROM images, built from the libreboot source code.
				These images are provided for user convenience, so that they don't have
				to build anything from source on their own.
			</p>

			<p>
				The ROM images in each archive use the following at the end of the file name,
				if they are built with the GRUB payload: <b>_<i>keymap</i>_<i>mode</i>.rom</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Available <i>modes</i>: <b>vesafb</b> or <b>txtmode</b>. The <i>vesafb</i> ROM images are recommended, in most cases;
				<i>txtmode</i> ROM images come with MemTest86+, which requires text-mode instead of the usual framebuffer used
				by coreboot native graphics initialization.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>keymap</i> can be one of several keymaps that keyboard supports (there are quite a few),
				which affects the keyboard layout configuration that is used in GRUB. It doesn't matter
				which ROM image you choose here, as far as the keymap in GNU/Linux is concerned.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keymaps are named appropriately according to each keyboard layout
				support in GRUB. To learn how these keymaps are created, see
				<a href="../grub/index.html#grub_keyboard">../grub/index.html#grub_keyboard</a>
			</p>
			
			<h2 id="qemu">QEMU</h2>
			
				<p>
					Libreboot comes with ROM images built for QEMU, by default:
				</p>

				<p>
					Examples of how to use libreboot ROM images in QEMU:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>$ <b>qemu-system-i386 -M q35 -m 512 -bios qemu_q35_ich9_keymap_mode.rom</b></li>
						<li>$ <b>qemu-system-i386 -M pc -m 512 -bios qemu_i440fx_piix4_keymap_mode.rom</b></li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					You can optionally specify the <b>-serial stdio</b> argument, so that QEMU will emulate
					a serial terminal on the standard input/output (most likely your terminal emulator or TTY).
				</p>
				<p>
					Other arguments are available for QEMU. The manual will contain more information.

		<h1 id="flashrom">How to update or install libreboot (if you are already running libreboot or coreboot)</h1>

			<p>
				On all current targets, updating libreboot can be accomplished without disassembly and,
				therefore, without having to externally re-flash using any dedicated hardware. In other words,
				you can do everything entirely in software, directly from the OS that is running on your libreboot
				system.
			</p>

			<div class="important">
				<p>
					<b>If you are using libreboot_src or git, then make sure that you built the sources first (see <a href="../git/index.html#build">../git/index.html#build</a>).</b>
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Look at the <a href="#rom">list of ROM images</a> to see which image is compatible with your device.
			</p>

			<h2>Are you currently running the original, proprietary firmware?</h2>

				<p>
					If you are currently running the proprietary firmware (not libreboot or coreboot),
					then the flashing instructions for your system are going to be different.
				</p>
				<p>
					X60/T60 users running the proprietary firmware should refer to <a href="#flashrom_lenovobios">#flashrom_lenovobios</a>.
					MacBook2,1 users running Apple EFI should refer to <a href="#flashrom_macbook21">#flashrom_macbook21</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					X200 users, refer to <a href="x200_external.html">x200_external.html</a>,
					R400 users refer to <a href="r400_external.html">r400_external.html</a>,
					R500 users refer to <a href="r500_external.html">r500_external.html</a>,
					T400 users refer to <a href="t400_external.html">t400_external.html</a>,

				</p>

			<h2>ASUS KFSN4-DRE?</h2>

				<p>
					Internal flashing should work just fine, even if you are
					currently booting the proprietary firmware.
				</p>

				<p>
					Libreboot currently lacks documentation for externally
					re-flashing an LPC flash chip. However, these boards have
					the flash chip inside of a PLCC socket, and it is possible
					to hot-swap the chips. If you want to back up your
					known-working image, simply hot-swap the chip for one that
					is the same capacity, after having dumped a copy of the
					current firmware (flashrom -p internal -r yourchosenname.rom),
					and then flash that chip with the known-working image.
					Check whether the system still boots, and if it does, then
					it should be safe to flash the new image (because you now
					have a backup of the old image).
				</p>

				<p>
					Keeping at least one spare LPC PLCC chip with working firmware
					on it is highly recommended, in case of bricks.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>
						DO NOT hot-swap the chip with your bare hands. Use a PLCC
						chip extractor. These can be found online.
						See <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools">http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools</a>
					</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Do check the HCL entry: <a href="../hcl/kfsn4-dre.html">../hcl/kfsn4-dre.html</a>
				</p>

			<h2>Are you currently running libreboot (or coreboot)?</h2>
				
				<p>
					X60/T60 users should be fine with this guide. If you write-protected the flash chip, please refer to 
					<a href="x60_unbrick.html">x60_unbrick.html</a>, <a href="x60tablet_unbrick.html">x60tablet_unbrick.html</a>
					or <a href="t60_unbrick.html">t60_unbrick.html</a>. <i>This probably does not apply to you. Most people
					do not write-protect the flash chip, so you probably didn't either.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly, it is possible to write-protect the flash chip in coreboot or libreboot on GM45 laptops
					(X200/R400/R500/T400/T500). If you did this, then you will need to use the links above for flashing, 
					treating your laptop as though it currently has the proprietary firmware (because write-protected SPI flash
					requires external re-flashing, as is also the case when running the proprietary firmware).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					If you did not write-protect the flash chip, or it came to you without any write-protection
					(<b><i>libreboot does not write-protect the flash chip by default, so this probably applies to you</i></b>),
					read on!
				</p>

			<h2>MAC address on GM45 (X200/R400/T400/T500)</h2>

				<p>
					<b>Users of the X200/R400/T400/T500 take note:</b> The MAC address for the onboard ethernet chipset
					is located inside the flash chip. Libreboot ROM images for these laptops contain a generic MAC
					address by default (00:F5:F0:40:71:FE), but this is not what you want.
					<i>Make sure to change the MAC address inside the ROM image, before flashing it.
					The instructions on <a href="../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen">../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen</a>
					show how to do this.</i>
				</p>

				<p>
					It is important that you change the default MAC address, before flashing. It will be printed on a sticker
					at the bottom of the laptop, or it will be printed on a sticker next to or underneath the RAM. Alternatively,
					and assuming that your current firmware has the correct MAC address in it, you can get it from your OS.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>
						R500 users: your laptop lacks a GbE region, because it has a different NIC. You do not need to change the MAC
						address on this laptop; it will already be correct. You can simply flash the available ROM images for the R500, as-is.
						See <a href="../hcl/r500.html#nogbe">../hcl/r500.html#nogbe</a>.
					</b>
				</p>

			<h2>Flash chip size</h2>

				<p>
					Use this to find out:<br/>
					# <b>dmidecode | grep ROM\ Size</b>
				</p>

			<h2>All good?</h2>

				<p>Excellent! Moving on...</p>

				<p>
					Download the <i>libreboot_util.tar.xz</i> archive, and extract it. Inside, you will find
					a directory called <i>flashrom</i>. This contains statically compiled executable files of
					the <i>flashrom</i> utility, which you will use to re-flash your libreboot system.
				</p>

				<p>
					Simply use <i>cd</i> on your terminal, to switch to the <i>libreboot_util</i> directory. Inside,
					there is a script called <i>flash</i>, which will detect what CPU architecture you have
					(e.g. i686, x86_64) and use the appropriate executable. It is also possible for you to
					build these executables from the libreboot source code archives.
				</p>

				<div class="important">
					<p>
						How to update the flash chip contents:<br/>
						$ <b>sudo ./flash update <a href="#rom">yourrom.rom</a></b>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="important">
					<p>
						Ocassionally, coreboot changes the name of a given board. If flashrom complains about a board mismatch, but
						you are sure that you chose the correct ROM image, then run this alternative command:<br/>
						$ <b>sudo ./flash forceupdate <a href="#rom">yourrom.rom</a></b>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="important">

					<p>
						You should see <b>&quot;Verifying flash... VERIFIED.&quot;</b> written at the end of the flashrom output. <b>Shut down</b>
						after you see this, and then boot up again after a few seconds.
