				If you don't want to install libreboot yourself, companies exist that sell these laptops
				with libreboot pre-installed, along with a free GNU/Linux distribution.

				The X200S and X200 Tablet will use a WSON-8 flash chip, on the
				bottom of the motherboard (this requires removal of the
				motherboard). <b>Not all X200S/X200T are supported;

			<p>
				On the X200/X200S/X200T, the MAC address for the onboard
				gigabit ethernet chipset is stored inside the flash chip,
				along with other configuration data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keep a note of the MAC address before disassembly; this is
				very important, because you will need to insert this into
				the libreboot ROM image before flashing it.
				It will be written in one of these locations:

Here is a photo of the SOIC-8 flash chip. The pins are labelled:<br/>

Look at the pads in that photo, on the left and right. Those are for SOIC-16. Would it be possible to remove the SOIC-8 and solder a SOIC-16
chip on those pins?
</pre>
			<p>
				<b>On the X200S and X200 Tablet the flash chip is underneath the board, in a WSON package. 
				The pinout is very much the same as a SOIC-8, except you need to solder (there are no clips available).<br/>
				The following image shows how this is done:</b><br/>
				<img src="images/x200/wson_soldered.jpg" title="Copyright 2014 Steve Shenton &lt;sgsit@libreboot.org&gt; see license notice at the end of this document" alt="" />
				<br/>
				In this image, a pin header was soldered onto the WSON. Another solution might be to de-solder the WSON-8 chip and put a SOIC-8 there instead.
				Check the list of SOIC-8 flash chips at <a href="../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#flashchips">../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#flashchips</a> but
				do note that these are only 4MiB (32Mb) chips. The only X200 SPI chips with 8MiB capacity are SOIC-16. For 8MiB capacity in this case,
				the X201 SOIC-8 flash chip (Macronix 25L6445E) might work.
			</p>

			<h2>
				The procedure
			</h2>
				<p>
					This section is for the X200. This does not apply to the X200S or X200 Tablet
					(for those systems, you have to remove the motherboard completely, since
					the flash chip is on the other side of the board).
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove these screws:<br/>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0003.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Push the keyboard forward, gently, then lift it off and 
					disconnect it from the board:<br/>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0004.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0005.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Pull the palm rest off, lifting from the left and right side at the back of the
					palm rest:<br/>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0006.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Lift back the tape that covers a part of the flash chip, and
					then connect the clip:<br/>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0007.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0008.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					On pin 2 of the BBB, where you have the ground (GND), connect the
					ground to your PSU:<br/>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0009.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0010.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Connect the 3.3V supply from your PSU to the flash chip (via
					the clip):<br/>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0011.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0012.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, make sure that your PSU is also plugged in and
					turn on:<br/>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0013.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					This tutorial tells you to use an ATX PSU, for the 3.3V DC
					supply. The PSU used when taking these photos is actually
					not an ATX PSU, but a PSU that is designed specifically
					for providing 3.3V DC (an ATX PSU will also work):<br/>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0014.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, you should be ready to install libreboot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Flashrom binaries for ARM (tested on a BBB) are distributed in libreboot_util. Alternatively,
					libreboot also distributes flashrom source code which can be built.
				</p>
				<p>
					Log in as root on your BBB, using the instructions in
					<a href="bbb_setup.html#bbb_access">bbb_setup.html#bbb_access</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Test that flashrom works:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512</b><br/>
					In this case, the output was:
				</p>
<pre>
flashrom v0.9.7-r1854 on Linux 3.8.13-bone47 (armv7l)
flashrom is free software, get the source code at http://www.flashrom.org

Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6406E/MX25L6436E&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Multiple flash chip definitions match the detected chip(s): &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot;, &quot;MX25L6406E/MX25L6436E&quot;, &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot;
Please specify which chip definition to use with the -c &lt;chipname&gt; option.
</pre>
				<p>
					How to backup factory.rom (change the -c option as neeed, for your flash chip):<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory1.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory2.rom</b><br/>
					Note: the <b>-c</b> option is not required in libreboot's patched flashrom, because
					the redundant flash chip definitions in <i>flashchips.c</i> have been removed.<br/>
					Now compare the 3 images:<br/>
					# <b>sha512sum factory*.rom</b><br/>
					If the hashes match, then just copy one of them (the factory.rom) to a safe place (on a drive connected to another system, not
					the BBB). This is useful for reverse engineering work, if there is a desirable behaviour in the original firmware
					that could be replicated in coreboot and libreboot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Follow the instructions at <a href="../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen">../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen</a>
					to change the MAC address inside the libreboot ROM image, before flashing it.
					Although there is a default MAC address inside the ROM image, this is not what you want. <b>Make sure
					to always change the MAC address to one that is correct for your system.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now flash it:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -w path/to/libreboot/rom/image.rom -V</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0015.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					You might see errors, but if it says <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end, then it's flashed and should boot.
					If you see errors, try again (and again, and again); the message <b>Chip content is identical to the requested image</b>
					is also an indication of a successful installation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Example output from running the command (see above):

				The X200 typically comes with an Intel wifi chipset, which does not
				work without proprietary software. For a list of wifi chipsets that
				work without proprietary software, see
				<a href="../hcl/index.html#recommended_wifi">../hcl/index.html#recommended_wifi</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some X200 laptops come with an Atheros chipset, but this is 802.11g only.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It is recommended that you install a new wifi chipset. This can only
				be done after installing libreboot, because the original firmware has
				a whitelist of approved chips, and it will refuse to boot if you
				use an 'unauthorized' wifi card.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The following photos show an Atheros AR5B95 being installed, to
				replace the Intel chip that this X200 came with:<br/>

				X200S and X200 Tablet users: GPIO33 trick will not work.
			</h2>
				<p>
					sgsit found out about a pin called GPIO33, which can be grounded to disable the flashing protections
					by the descriptor and stop the ME from starting (which itself interferes with flashing attempts).
					The theory was proven correct; however, it is still useless in practise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Look just above the 7 in TP37 (that's GPIO33):<br/>
					<img src="../hcl/images/x200/gpio33_location.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					By default we would see this in lenovobios, when trying flashrom -p internal -w rom.rom:
				</p>
<pre>
FREG0: Warning: Flash Descriptor region (0x00000000-0x00000fff) is read-only.
FREG2: Warning: Management Engine region (0x00001000-0x005f5fff) is locked.
</pre>
				<p>
					With GPIO33 grounded during boot, this disabled the flash protections as set
					by descriptor, and stopped the ME from starting. The output changed to:
				</p>
<pre>
The Flash Descriptor Override Strap-Pin is set. Restrictions implied by
the Master Section of the flash descriptor are NOT in effect. Please note
that <b>Protected Range (PR) restrictions still apply.</b>
</pre>
				<p>
					The part in bold is what got us. This was still observed:
				</p>
<pre>
PR0: Warning: 0x007e0000-0x01ffffff is read-only.
PR4: Warning: 0x005f8000-0x005fffff is locked.
</pre>

				<p>
					It is actually possible to disable these protections. Lenovobios does,
					when updating the BIOS (proprietary one). One possible way to go about this
					would be to debug the BIOS update utility from Lenovo, to find out
					how it's disabling these protections. Some more research is available here:
					<a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x200/internal_flashing_research">http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x200/internal_flashing_research</a>

				<p>
					On a related note, libreboot has a utility that could help with investigating this:
