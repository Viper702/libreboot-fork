			<p>Initial flashing instructions for kcma-d8.</p>
			<p>
				This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ASUS kcma-d8
				motherboard, while they still have the proprietary ASUS BIOS present.
				This guide can also be followed (adapted) if you brick you board, to know
				how to recover.

            <p>
                <b>Memory initialization is still problematic, for some modules. We recommend avoiding Kingston modules.</b>
            </p>
			<p>
				For more general information about this board, refer to
				<a href="../hcl/kcma-d8.html">../hcl/kcma-d8.html</a>.

				Refer to <a href="bbb_setup.html">bbb_setup.html</a> for a guide on
				how to set up an external SPI programmer.
			</p>
			<p>
				The flash chip is in a PDIP 8 socket (SPI flash chip) on the motherboard,
				which you take out and then re-flash with libreboot, using the programmer.
				<b>DO NOT</b> remove the chip with your hands. Use a chip extractor tool.
