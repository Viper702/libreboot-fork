			<p>
				You still have Lenovo BIOS, or you had libreboot running and you flashed another ROM; and you had bucts 1 set and
				the ROM wasn't dd'd.* or if Lenovo BIOS was present and libreboot wasn't flashed.<br/><br/>

				In this case, unbricking is easy: reset BUC.TS to 0 by removing that yellow cmos coin (it's a battery) and putting it back after a minute or two:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0006.JPG" alt="" /><br/><br/>

				*Those dd commands should be applied to all newly compiled T60 ROM images (the ROM images in libreboot binary archives already have this applied!):<br/>
				dd if=coreboot.rom of=top64k.bin bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x10000] count=64k<br/>
				dd if=coreboot.rom bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k | hexdump<br/>
				dd if=top64k.bin of=coreboot.rom bs=1 seek=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k conv=notrunc<br/>
				(doing this makes the ROM suitable for use when flashing a system that still has Lenovo BIOS running,
				using those instructions: <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation">http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation</a>.
				(it says x60, but instructions for t60 are identical)

		<h1 id="recovery">bad rom (or user error), system won't boot</h1>

			<p>
				In this scenario, you compiled a ROM that had an incorrect configuration, or there is an actual bug preventing your system from
				booting. Or, maybe, you set BUC.TS to 0 and shut down after first flash while Lenovo BIOS was running. In any case, your system is bricked and will not boot at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;Unbricking&quot; means flashing a known-good (working) ROM. The problem: you can't boot the system, making this difficult. In this situation, external hardware (see hardware requirements above) is needed which can flash the SPI chip (where libreboot resides).
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove those screws and remove the HDD:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0001.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0002.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Lift off the palm rest:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0003.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Lift up the keyboard, pull it back a bit, flip it over like that and then disconnect it from the board:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0004.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0005.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0006.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Gently wedge both sides loose:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0007.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0008.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove that cable from the position:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0009.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0010.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Now remove that bezel. Remove wifi, nvram battery and speaker connector (also remove 56k modem, on the left of wifi):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0011.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove those screws:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0012.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect the power jack:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0013.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove nvram battery:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0014.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect cable (for 56k modem) and disconnect the other cable:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0015.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0016.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect speaker cable:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0017.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect the other end of the 56k modem cable:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0018.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Make sure you removed it:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0019.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Unscrew those:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0020.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Make sure you removed those:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0021.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Disconnect LCD cable from board:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0022.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p> 
				Remove those screws then remove the LCD assembly:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0023.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0024.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0025.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Once again, make sure you removed those:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0026.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the shielding containing the motherboard, then flip it over. Remove these screws, placing them on a steady
				surface in the same layout as they were in before you removed them. Also, you should mark each screw hole after removing the
				screw (a permanent marker pen will do), this is so that you have a point of reference when re-assembling the system:<br/>

				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0031.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0032.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0033.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Now wire up the BBB and the Pomona with your PSU.<br/>
				Refer to <a href="bbb_setup.html">bbb_setup.html</a> for how to setup
				the BBB for flashing.<br/>
				<b>Note, the guide mentions a 3.3v DC PSU but you don't need this on the T60:
				if you don't have or don't want to use an external PSU, then make
				sure not to connect the 3.3v leads mentioned in the guide;
				instead, connect the AC adapter (the one that normally charges your
				battery) so that the board has power (but don't boot it up)</b><br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0030.JPG" alt="" /><br/>
				Correlate the following with the BBB guide linked above:
			</p>
<pre>
POMONA 5250:
===  DVD drive ====
 18              -       - 1
 22              -       - NC				---- RAM is on this end
 NC              -       - 21
 3.3V (PSU)      -       - 17 - this is pin 1 on the flash chip
===  audio jacks ===
<i>This is how you will connect. Numbers refer to pin numbers on the BBB, on the plugs near the DC jack.</i>
</pre>

			<p>
				Connect the pomona from the BBB to the flash chip. No pics unfortunately. (use the text diagram above).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Flashrom binaries for ARM (tested on a BBB) are distributed in libreboot_util. Alternatively,
				libreboot also distributes flashrom source code which can be built.
			</p>

			<p>
				SSH'd into the BBB:<br/>
				# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -w yourrom.rom</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				It should be <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end. If flashrom complains about multiple flash chip
				definitions detected, then choose one of them following the instructions in the output.
			</p>

			<p>
				Put those screws back:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0047.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Put it back into lower chassis:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0048.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Attach LCD and insert screws (also, attach the lcd cable to the board):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0049.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Insert those screws:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0050.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				On the CPU (and there is another chip south-east to it, sorry forgot to take pic)
				clean off the old thermal paste (with the alcohol) and apply new (Artic Silver 5 is good, others are good too)
				you should also clean the heatsink the same way<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0051.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Attach the heatsink and install the screws (also, make sure to install the AC jack as highlighted):<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0052.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Reinstall that upper bezel:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0053.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Do that:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0054.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0055.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Re-attach modem, wifi, (wwan?), and all necessary cables. Sorry, forgot to take pics. Look at previous removal steps to see where they go back to.
			</p>

			<p>
				Attach keyboard and install nvram battery:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0056.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0057.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Place keyboard and (sorry, forgot to take pics) reinstall the palmrest and insert screws on the underside:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0058.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				It lives!<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0071.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0072.JPG" alt="" /> <img src="../images/t60_dev/0073.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Always stress test ('stress -c 2' and xsensors. below 90C is ok) when replacing cpu paste/heatsink:<br/>
				<img src="../images/t60_dev/0074.JPG" alt="" />
