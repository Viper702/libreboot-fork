			<p>Initial flashing instructions for R500.</p>
			<p>
				This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ThinkPad R500
				while they still have the original Lenovo BIOS present. This guide
				can also be followed (adapted) if you brick your R500, to know how
				to recover.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before following this section, please make sure to setup your libreboot ROM properly first. 
				Although ROM images are provided pre-built in libreboot, there are some modifications that 
				you need to make to the one you chose before flashing. (instructions referenced later in
				this guide)
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>
					NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518. To use it in libreboot, for now, you
					must build for it from source using the libreboot git repository.

			<p>
				EHCI debug might not be needed. It has been reported that the docking station
				for this laptop has a serial port, so it might be possible to use that instead.

		<h1>A note about CPUs</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:R500">ThinkWiki</a> has a list of CPUs
				for this system. The Core 2 Duo P8400, P8600 and P8700 are believed to work in libreboot.
				The Core 2 Duo T9600 was confirmed to work (on a different laptop, but still GM45), so the T9400 probably also works.
				<b>The Core 2 Duo T5870/5670 and Celeron M 575/585 are untested!</b>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Quad-core CPUs</h2>
			
				<p>
					Although blocked by lenovobios (as was reported), it is reported that there are quad-core CPUs
					for GM45. This laptop has socketed CPUs, so it might be possible to use them
					(they are untested in coreboot; support may have to be added).
					Core 2 Quad Q9000, Q9100 or QX9300.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Look at this link:<br/>

		<h1>A note about GPUs</h1>

			<p>
				<a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:R500">ThinkWiki</a> lists
				two possible GPUs: Intel or ATI. Only the Intel GPUs work in libreboot; the ATI
				GPUs require a proprietary Video BIOS, and so those are unsupported in libreboot.
			</p>
			<p>
				On other GM45 laptops in libreboot (e.g. T400, T500), so-called <i>switchable graphics</i>
				is used, which means that the laptop will have <b>both</b> an ATI and Intel GPU, or it will
				only have Intel, depending on which variation you have. On the systems with ATI and Intel,
				you can disable the ATI GPU and use only the Intel GPU, which works in libreboot.
			</p>
			<div class="important">
				<p>
					<b>
						It is unknown whether R500 laptops with an ATI GPU still have an Intel GPU, where you could
						disable the ATI GPU and use the Intel GPU. These are budget laptops, so it's highly likely
						that Lenovo decided on this model to ship with one GPU or the other, but not both (GPUs cost money).
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>
						It is **HIGHLY** recommended, when ordering an R500 laptop, to **ENSURE** that the
						one you're ordering has an Intel GPU.

				Use this to find out:<br>
				# <b>dmidecode | grep ROM\ Size</b><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				It is believed that all R500 laptops have only SOIC-8 (4MiB) chips.

		<h1 id="macaddress">MAC address</h1>
		
			<p>
				Unlike other GM45 thinkpads, the R500 has a different onboard gigabit NIC,
				where the MAC address is built-in. You do not need to change the MAC address
				at all on this laptop; simply flash the provided ROM images, as-is.

		<h1>Initial BBB configuration</h1>
		
			<p>
				Refer to <a href="bbb_setup.html">bbb_setup.html</a> for how to
				setup the BBB for flashing.
			</p>

			<p>
				The following shows how to connect clip to the BBB	(on the P9 header), for SOIC-8 (clip: Pomona 5250):
			</p>
<pre>
POMONA 5250 (correlate with the BBB guide)
===  VGA and ethernet socket ===
 18              -       - 1
 22              -       - NC
 NC              -       - 21
 3.3V (PSU)      -       - 17 - this is pin 1 on the flash chip
===  DVD drive ===
<i>This is how you will connect. Numbers refer to pin numbers on the BBB, on the plugs near the DC jack.</i><br/>

					A dedicated 3.3V PSU was used to create this guide, but
					at ATX PSU is also fine:<br/>
					<img src="images/t400/0072.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Of course, make sure to turn on your PSU:<br/>

				</p>

				<p>
					Now, you should be ready to install libreboot.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Flashrom binaries for ARM (tested on a BBB) are distributed in libreboot_util. Alternatively,
					libreboot also distributes flashrom source code which can be built.
				</p>
				<p>
					Log in as root on your BBB, using the instructions in <a href="bbb_setup.html#bbb_access">bbb_setup.html#bbb_access</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Test that flashrom works:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512</b><br/>
					In this case, the output was:
				</p>
<pre>
flashrom v0.9.7-r1854 on Linux 3.8.13-bone47 (armv7l)
flashrom is free software, get the source code at http://www.flashrom.org
Calibrating delay loop... OK.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6406E/MX25L6436E&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Multiple flash chip definitions match the detected chip(s): &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot;, &quot;MX25L6406E/MX25L6436E&quot;, &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot;
Please specify which chip definition to use with the -c &lt;chipname&gt; option.
</pre>
				<p>
					How to backup factory.rom (change the -c option as neeed, for your flash chip):<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory1.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory2.rom</b><br/>
					Note: the <b>-c</b> option is not required in libreboot's patched flashrom, because
					the redundant flash chip definitions in <i>flashchips.c</i> have been removed.<br/>
					Now compare the 3 images:<br/>
					# <b>sha512sum factory*.rom</b><br/>
					If the hashes match, then just copy one of them (the factory.rom) to a safe place (on a drive connected to another system, not
					the BBB). This is useful for reverse engineering work, if there is a desirable behaviour in the original firmware
					that could be replicated in coreboot and libreboot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now flash it:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -w path/to/libreboot/rom/image.rom -V</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0015.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					You might see errors, but if it says <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end, then it's flashed and should boot.
					If you see errors, try again (and again, and again); the message <b>Chip content is identical to the requested image</b>
					is also an indication of a successful installation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Example output from running the command (see above):

		<h1>Thermal paste (IMPORTANT)</h1>
	
			<p>
				Because part of this procedure involved removing the heatsink, you will need to apply new paste.
				Arctic Silver 5 is ok. You will also need isopropyl alcohol and an anti-static cloth to clean with.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When re-installing the heatsink, you must first clean off all old paste with the alcohol/cloth.
				Then apply new paste. AS5 is also much better than the default paste used on these systems.

			<p>
				The R500 typically comes with an Intel wifi chipset, which does not
				work without proprietary software. For a list of wifi chipsets that
				work without proprietary software, see
				<a href="../hcl/index.html#recommended_wifi">../hcl/index.html#recommended_wifi</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some R500 laptops might come with an Atheros chipset, but this is 802.11g only.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It is recommended that you install a new wifi chipset. This can only
				be done after installing libreboot, because the original firmware has
				a whitelist of approved chips, and it will refuse to boot if you
				use an 'unauthorized' wifi card.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The following photos show an Atheros AR5B95 being installed, to
				replace the Intel chip that this R500 came with:<br/>

				If you have a WWAN/3G card and/or sim card reader, remove them permanently. 
				The WWAN-3G card has proprietary firmware inside; the technology is
				identical to what is used in mobile phones, so it can also track your movements.
