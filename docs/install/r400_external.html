			<p>Initial flashing instructions for R400.</p>
			<p>
				This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ThinkPad R400
				while they still have the original Lenovo BIOS present. This guide
				can also be followed (adapted) if you brick your R400, to know how
				to recover.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before following this section, please make sure to setup your libreboot ROM properly first. 
				Although ROM images are provided pre-built in libreboot, there are some modifications that 
				you need to make to the one you chose before flashing. (instructions referenced later in
				this guide)

		<h1>A note about CPUs</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:R400">ThinkWiki</a> has a list of CPUs
				for this system. The Core 2 Duo P8400 and P8600 are believed to work in libreboot.
				The Core 2 Duo T9600 was confirmed to work, so the T9400 probably also works.
				<b>The Core 2 Duo T5870/5670 and Celeron M 575/585 are untested!</b>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Quad-core CPUs</h2>
			
				<p>
					Incompatible. Do not use.

	<div class="section" id="switchable_graphics">
	
		<h1>A note about GPUs</h1>
		
			<p>
				Some models have an Intel GPU, while others have both an ATI and an Intel GPU; this
				is referred to as &quot;switchable graphics&quot;. In the <i>BIOS setup</i> program
				for lenovobios, you can specify that the system will use one or the other (but not both).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Libreboot is known to work on systems with only the Intel GPU, using native graphics initialization.
				On systems with switchable graphics, the Intel GPU is used and the ATI GPU is disabled, so
				native graphics initialization works all the same.

		<h1 id="macaddress">MAC address</h1>
		
			<p>
				On the R400, the MAC address for the onboard
				gigabit ethernet chipset is stored inside the flash chip,
				along with other configuration data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keep a note of the MAC address before disassembly; this is
				very important, because you will need to insert this into
				the libreboot ROM image before flashing it.
				It will be written in one of these locations:

					Of course, make sure to turn on your PSU:<br/>

				</p>

				<p>
					Now, you should be ready to install libreboot.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Flashrom binaries for ARM (tested on a BBB) are distributed in libreboot_util. Alternatively,
					libreboot also distributes flashrom source code which can be built.
				</p>
				<p>
					Log in as root on your BBB, using the instructions in <a href="bbb_setup.html#bbb_access">bbb_setup.html#bbb_access</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Test that flashrom works:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512</b><br/>
					In this case, the output was:

Found Macronix flash chip &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot; (8192 kB, SPI) on linux_spi.
Multiple flash chip definitions match the detected chip(s): &quot;MX25L6405(D)&quot;, &quot;MX25L6406E/MX25L6436E&quot;, &quot;MX25L6445E/MX25L6473E&quot;
Please specify which chip definition to use with the -c &lt;chipname&gt; option.
</pre>
				<p>
					How to backup factory.rom (change the -c option as neeed, for your flash chip):<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory1.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory2.rom</b><br/>
					Note: the <b>-c</b> option is not required in libreboot's patched flashrom, because
					the redundant flash chip definitions in <i>flashchips.c</i> have been removed.<br/>
					Now compare the 3 images:<br/>
					# <b>sha512sum factory*.rom</b><br/>
					If the hashes match, then just copy one of them (the factory.rom) to a safe place (on a drive connected to another system, not
					the BBB). This is useful for reverse engineering work, if there is a desirable behaviour in the original firmware
					that could be replicated in coreboot and libreboot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Follow the instructions at <a href="../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen">../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen</a>
					to change the MAC address inside the libreboot ROM image, before flashing it.
					Although there is a default MAC address inside the ROM image, this is not what you want. <b>Make sure
					to always change the MAC address to one that is correct for your system.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now flash it:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -w path/to/libreboot/rom/image.rom -V</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0015.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					You might see errors, but if it says <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end, then it's flashed and should boot.
					If you see errors, try again (and again, and again); the message <b>Chip content is identical to the requested image</b>
					is also an indication of a successful installation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Example output from running the command (see above):

		<h1>Thermal paste (IMPORTANT)</h1>
	
			<p>
				Because part of this procedure involved removing the heatsink, you will need to apply new paste.
				Arctic MX-4 is ok. You will also need isopropyl alcohol and an anti-static cloth to clean with.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When re-installing the heatsink, you must first clean off all old paste with the alcohol/cloth.
				Then apply new paste. Arctic MX-4 is also much better than the default paste used on these systems.

				The R400 typically comes with an Intel wifi chipset, which does not

				Some R400 laptops might come with an Atheros chipset, but this is 802.11g only.

			<p>
				It is recommended that you install a new wifi chipset. This can only
				be done after installing libreboot, because the original firmware has
				a whitelist of approved chips, and it will refuse to boot if you
				use an 'unauthorized' wifi card.
