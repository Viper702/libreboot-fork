                Here is an image of the flash chip:<br/>

            </p>
            <p>
                Internal flashing is possible. Boot with the proprietary BIOS
                and GNU/Linux. There are 2 flash chips (one is backup).
            </p>
            <p>
                Flash the first chip:
                <br/>
                <strong>./flashrom -p internal:dualbiosindex=0 -w libreboot.rom</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Flash the second chip:
                <br/>
                <strong>./flashrom -p internal:dualbiosindex=1 -w libreboot.rom</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: You need the latest flashrom. Just get it on flashrom.org from
                their SVN or Git repos.
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: due to a bug in the hardware, the MAC address is hardcoded in coreboot-libre.
                Therefore, you must set your own MAC address in your operating system.
